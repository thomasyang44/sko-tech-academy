We welcome your collaboration & contributions happily, as our reference applications are meant to reflect your real world scenarios. There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs and improvement suggestions, improve documentation, and contribute code. Bug reports, documentation changes, and feature requests \u00b6 If you would like to contribute your experience with an IBM Cloud Architecture project back to the project in the form of encountered bug reports, necessary documentation changes, or new feature requests, this can be done through the use of the repository's Issues list. Before opening a new issue, please reference the existing list to make sure a similar or duplicate item does not already exist. Otherwise, please be as explicit as possible when creating the new item and be sure to include the following: Bug reports Specific Project Version Deployment environment A minimal, but complete, setup of steps to recreate the problem Documentation changes URL to existing incorrect or incomplete documentation (either in the project's GitHub repo or external product documentation) Updates required to correct current inconsistency If possible, a link to a project fork, sample, or workflow to expose the gap in documentation. Feature requests Complete description of project feature request, including but not limited to, components of the existing project that are impacted, as well as additional components that may need to be created. A minimal, but complete, setup of steps to recreate environment necessary to identify the new feature's current gap. The more explicit and thorough you are in opening GitHub Issues, the more efficient your interaction with the maintainers will be. When creating the GitHub Issue for your bug report, documentation change, or feature request, be sure to add as many relevant labels as necessary (that are defined for that specific project). These will vary by project, but will be helpful to the maintainers in quickly triaging your new GitHub issues. Code contributions \u00b6 We really value contributions, and to maximize the impact of code contributions, we request that any contributions follow the guidelines below. If you are new to open source contribution and would like some more pointers or guidance, you may want to check out Your First PR and First Timers Only . These are a few projects that help on-board new contributors to the overall process. Coding and Pull Requests best practices \u00b6 Please ensure you follow the coding standard and code formatting used throughout the existing code base. This may vary project by project, but any specific diversion from normal language standards will be explicitly noted. One feature / bug fix / documentation update per pull request Always pull the latest changes from upstream and rebase before creating any pull request. New pull requests should be created against the integration branch of the repository, if available. This ensures new code is included in full-stack integration tests before being merged into the master branch All new features must be accompanied by associated tests. Make sure all tests pass locally before submitting a pull request. Include tests with every feature enhancement, improve tests with every bug fix Github and git flow \u00b6 The internet is littered with guides and information on how to use and understand git. However, here's a compact guide that follows the suggested workflow Fork the desired repo in github. Clone your repo to your local computer. Add the upstream repository Note: Guide for step 1-3 here: forking a repo Create new development branch off the targeted upstream branch. This will often be master . git checkout -b <my-feature-branch> master Do your work: Write your code Write your tests Pass your tests locally Commit your intermediate changes as you go and as appropriate Repeat until satisfied Fetch latest upstream changes (in case other changes had been delivered upstream while you were developing your new feature). git fetch upstream Rebase to the latest upstream changes, resolving any conflicts. This will 'replay' your local commits, one by one, after the changes delivered upstream while you were locally developing, letting you manually resolve any conflict. git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master git rebase Instructions on how to manually resolve a conflict and commit the new change or skip your local replayed commit will be presented on screen by the git CLI. Push the changes to your repository git push origin <my-feature-branch> Create a pull request against the same targeted upstream branch. Creating a pull request Once the pull request has been reviewed, accepted and merged into the main github repository, you should synchronise your remote and local forked github repository master branch with the upstream master branch. To do so: Pull to your local forked repository the latest changes upstream (that is, the pull request). git pull upstream master Push those latest upstream changes pulled locally to your remote forked repository. git push origin master What happens next? \u00b6 All pull requests will be automatically built and unit tested by travis-ci, when implemented by that specific project. You can determine if a given project is enabled for travis-ci unit tests by the existence of a .travis.yml file in the root of the repository or branch. When in use, all travis-ci unit tests must pass completely before any further review or discussion takes place. The repository maintainer will then inspect the commit and, if accepted, will pull the code into the upstream branch. Should a maintainer or reviewer ask for changes to be made to the pull request, these can be made locally and pushed to your forked repository and branch. Commits passing this stage will make it into the next release cycle for the given project.","title":"Contributing to this Site"},{"location":"contribute/#bug-reports-documentation-changes-and-feature-requests","text":"If you would like to contribute your experience with an IBM Cloud Architecture project back to the project in the form of encountered bug reports, necessary documentation changes, or new feature requests, this can be done through the use of the repository's Issues list.

Go to top | Go to Getting Start Lab 9. Summary \u00b6 Expand to view We just used decision automation, a capability within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, to automate an accounts payable process. With growing volumes of invoices, business rule automation helps reduce the amount of human intervention for account processing, detect issues earlier, and incorporate changes quickly when needed. Go to top | Go to Getting Start Lab Full Demo Narration \u00b6 Expand to view Demo Narration and Flow Demo Start Page Reviewing the demo launch page we see a text summary describing the demo and a discovery map diagram for our reference. We will only focus on the Validate Invoice Data step in the flow. OK, let's launch the demo. Customer invoice submissions We start by becoming the customer. From the Focus Corp Accounts Payable Invoices portal, we select an invoice ending with R (therefore it should be rejected) and submit for rule validation. We review five key data fields extracted from the invoice using intelligent document processing and then submit for validation. This invoice is rejected by the business rules as the total amount must be greater than 0. Let's resubmit that invoice by fixing the total amount to $100 and see what the rules say. We can also take a look at the fields that the business rules use to make their decision. And this time, the corrected invoice is accepted and passes rule validation. We have various other invoices to try, let's select another one ending in R that should be rejected, but this time the rules do not find an issue and it is accepted. This type of result means more rework in downstream business processes as humans are involved in more review and the invoice is routed back and forth to be fixed. Operations week 1 Further, we can see from the Operations Specialist's Accounts Payable dashboard that the average invoice processing time in the upper right is unmanageable at above 100 minutes. Further, the rules deviated from the final result on more than 60 invoices this week, adding to rework. Rules must change at the speed of the changing business so let's see how we can improve the business rules. Rules manager As a rules manager, we have access to the invoice validation decision model. The invoice data move from the oval at the bottom through multiple sub-decisions including a text rule to check the total amount is more than $0 which resulted in our first invoice being rejected. Another decision table looks for combinations of PO numbers and supplier types that do not follow the correct pattern (update!). This is where the second invoice should have be rejected but the table is missing a new invalid pattern. The rules manager, a business user, edits the decision model, adds a new row, easily does a copy/paste of the existing row to get a head start, exactly like a spreadsheet, adjusts the values to match the new Inc. based rejection pattern and the rule is ready. Tables automatically generate multiple text rules that follow the same pattern so we do not have to write them all from scratch. Let's validate our work in real time by running the same test case as before that should have been rejected. Great, and with the new rule we get the rejection reason we just created. Once they save the new decision model for audit and compliance, the rule manager can run an automated regression test but instead we'll move on to simulation. Loading an old simulation report before the rule change, we see rule metrics including the number of invoices approved and rejected as well as trends by date and invoice amount. No high invoice amounts are being rejected, interesting. The business knows most of the high value invoices are Inc. vendors so the new rule should catch more of these errors. After running a new simulation and comparing side by side, the business can make an informed decision about the impact of new rules before ever deploying to production. Yes, this looks as expected so we are ready to deploy. In this case, the business can deploy on their own but this can be configured for only certain safe rules and others must go through IT testing. Customer approved to rejected After the rules manager deploys the new rules, we go back to the invoice submission and choose the same invoice that should now be rejected. We see the invalid pattern of PO number and supplier type and we select in the demo control panel to upgrade to the latest rule version. The results, rejected with the reason code deployed by the business rule manager. Operations week 2 After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist reviews their updated dashboard and sees solid improvement with a reduction of average invoice processing time from less invoice rework and also less deviation between the rules and the final invoice decision. Our rules are more accurate. Use Case Summary We just used decision automation, a capability within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, to automate an accounts payable process.

Click to select the name of the automation service you published earlier and then select all the operations and click Next . 4. Now that you the automation service is in the palette on the right, click and drag it into the application as pictured below (or you can choose another location if you prefer). 5. First, select the operation at the top as HR_Send_Offer_Letter . 6. Now, we need to map data stored in the application (provided by the template) to the automation service so it will be sent to the HR Send Offer Letter process. Make the following changes for the first variable row in the Inputs section: 6a. under Variable options , click the drop down and select Use existing variable 6b. under Variable names , click Select and expand selectedCandidateDetails and select fullname . 6c. under Create field , uncheck the box as we do not need to see the candidates name since it is already in the upper left corner. 7. Repeat the same three steps above, selecting selectedCandidateDetails -> personalEmail for the second step. 8. Click Done . A new button is added to the application that will launch the process and send the two variables automatically! 9. Feel free to click the button and edit it using the palette that appears directly below. I would recommend using the pencil to change the name and you can also use the paint bucket to change the color. Next, we will add the second automation service to the application, a decision service to calculate a suggested salary based on information from the candidate and position. 10. Use the right palette to click and drag the same automation service on to the application, this time below the blue header (or in a location you prefer). 11. Select the operation at the top as Calculate_Candidate_Salary_Range . 12. Map the data stored in the application to the automation service as before so the business rules can use it to make the decision. Make the following changes for the first variable row in the Inputs section: 12a. under Variable options , click the drop down and select Use existing variable 12b. under Variable names , click Select and expand selectedCandidateDetails -> jobDetails -> jobStatus . 12c. under Create field , uncheck the box. 13. Repeat the same three steps above for the remaining three variables using the following values for the second step: 13a. selectedCandidateDetails -> country 13b. selectedCandidateDetails -> jobDetails -> jobLevel 14c. selectedCandidateDetails -> employmentType 14. For the output variable at the bottom, you may retain the defaults to Create a new variable and Create field on page . 15. Click Done . The result is that three elements are added to the page: a button to launch the service and two decimal/numeric fields for the output of minimum and maximum. 16. If you wish, you can perform some layout to move them around. For example, right click on the button just added and create a horizontal layout or panel before it, then drag the three elements into it. 17. You may also try clicking on one of the numeric fields such as Minimum and clicking the gear to configure it, try to locate Format and set it to Currency to automatically show a currency symbol for your country.

After we connect to Business Automation Workflow HR environment, Studio prompts us to select our the application and operations to automatically import. We'll select send offer letter and calculate salary range. The Studio imports and automatically publishes a service and we can confirm the operations and relevant inputs and outputs. Now we are ready to create our application! Preview onboarding application template Studio includes multiple templates to start from, let's preview and try out the Onboarding Application template. The app pulls in our sample requisition and candidate data and provides an easy to use search and filter on the left. After selecting a candidate, we see their details and status; let's mark Alicia as Prepare to onboard, and then change some document status values. Create application from template This template looks good, let's use it to create our own application. Add automation service We start in the low-code Application Designer and it's time to import our automation services from before so we can add them to the app. It's as simple as drag and drop. Let's add a button for send offer letter at the upper right, we select the operation, map the data since it already exists in our app from the template, and my button is automatically added. Don't like grey buttons? Change it to yellow, rename it, add an icon and make it a little smaller. All with no code, we just integrated to an existing external workflow from inside our app! We also need to add that calculation service that uses business rules to decide a recommended salary range. Let's drag it just below the right header and map the data in very much the same way as the other service. This service returns an output so we let Application Designer create a new variable to hold it and add it to the page automatically, so simple. With multiple elements on the screen, let's do some simple layout by adding a panel and dragging the fields into it. We can also do advanced formatting such as setting the field to currency for the symbols and decimal places or moving to advanced mode to set a read only status and much more. After doing the same to the second field, and formatting the button, we are ready to preview our app! Preview and use automation services Now in the running app, after selecting one of the candidates we immediately see our edits live. First, let's calculate the salary range and see the values that the decision service brings back based on the candidate data. Now, before we launch the send offer letter process, let's bring up the current work list. On the right we see one task from an older process. Now when we click to send a new offer letter, another task appears on the right for the assignee to complete. For testing, we can even open the task and see the application passed along the required data. Looks good to me. Run in Navigator After deploying to the production runtime, called Navigator, we can see the app appear on our home screen, run it and use it as before during the preview but now in a unified Navigator environment with multiple applications and tabs all in one experience and interface! Use Case Summary We just used the low-code Studio environment and its Application Designer to create a dynamic business application from a pre-built template to accelerate time to value. Then we connected to external automation services including existing workflows and decision services, to help automate the onboarding process. It's time to remove frustration and slow business results and replace them with productive and happy employees and customers.

Lucy along with other reviewers are able to review all the information and documents pertaining to applicant John Doe in the teamspace in a consistent and secure manner using an intuitive user-interface. Some of the information such as the applicant's SSN, is available on some of the documents but they are redacted so that only reviewers with the appropriate permission are able to see the redacted content. The use of video bookmarks also allows Lucy to quickly jump to key sections of the video without necessarily having to watch the entire video.

Tour IBM Navigator \u00b6 Expand to view IBM Navigator is a desktop for an organization's workers to find and organize information. You are now a Human Resources (HR) Onboarding Specialist, Lucy, at Focus Corp reviewing an applicant, John Doe, for employment. As an onboarding specialist, Lucy will use the IBM Navigator user interface to review content submitted by John such as the employment application and video interview. Let's take a quick tour of the IBM Navigator user interface. 1. Click on the navigation menu icon in the upper left corner of the screen The navigation menu icon (also commonly referred to as the hamburger icon) is used to access the navigation menu and features such as Browse , Search , Share , Teamspaces , Work , Cases and Reports . Additional features can also be added using plugins. This interface including the top banner, list of features and menu options are configurable through the use of desktops. Note: The Reports feature is used for Records Management and may or may not be installed on your environment. Records Management related activities such as declaring a record can be done automatically and also manually using the Browse feature. The Work and Cases feature show workflow tasks assigned to the user and case manager activities (respectively). 2. Click the Browse feature You are now viewing a repository called Corporate Operations which is an IBM FileNet Content Manager repository. Note You can also access other repositories and perform cross-repository searches using CM8 (IBM Content Manager), CMOD (IBM Content Manager OnDemand), Box\u00ae and CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) compliant repositories like Alfresco\u00ae and Microsoft SharePoint\u00ae On-Premises. 3. From the folder structure on the left side of the screen, traverse and click on the Focus Corp Docs / Human Resources / Onboarded Employees folder representing content for onboarded employees. As shown the diagram above, the center or content area of the screen shows the selected content which may also be used to traverse the folder structure. Additionally, the top of the content area displays the full folder structure of the selected content. 4. Click on the Selena Swift checkbox as shown in the diagram below. Please note that the folder can be selected by either clicking on the checkbox -OR- by clicking on the folder row. If a checkbox is not visible, contact your administrator to enable Content list checkboxes at the desktop level. Clicking on the folder name text will select the folder and additionally traverse into the folder. For onboarded employee \u2013 Selena Swift , you can see custom folder properties such as the First Name , Last Name , Employee ID , Onboarded status and Hire Date . 5. Navigate to the Focus Corp Docs / Human Resources / Onboarded Employees / Selena Swift / Employee Packet folder and then click on the checkbox for the first document. Next, in the upper-right corner, select the different Views ( Details , Magazine , Filmstrip ). As shown in the diagram below, the Details view is shown as the default view. In our example, Focus Corp maintains an Employee Packet folder that contains new employee info documents such as the Confidentiality Agreement and Employee Manual . In the Details view, you are able to see the thumbnail and properties of the selected content. 6. Select the Magazine view In the Magazine view, you can now see the same content along with social features such as Likes , Tags , Downloads and Comments . 7. Select the Filmstrip view. The Filmstrip view is very useful for looking at media such pictures. Select the Photos folder below the Employee Packet folder and then select each picture document. Go to top | Go to Getting Started Lab 4. Create and Review Teamspace \u00b6 Expand to view Let\u2019s now look at teamspaces. Teamspaces represent a focused view of the relevant folders, documents and searches that a team needs to complete their tasks. Our use case revolves around Lucy reviewing an existing teamspace for employee applicant John Doe. Typicaly, the teamspace would already be created, processed and reviewed by a few HR processors before reaching Lucy to further review and approve the applicant for onboarding. In this section, you first create an employee onboarding teamspace for the employee applicant John Doe. Next, you will review how a teamspace is used once it is created. 4.1 - Create Teamspace An Employee Onboarding teamspace template should already be available. If not or if you want to learn more about creating teamspace templates, please proceed to the section below - 4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder . Otherwise, proceed to section 4.1.2 - Teamspace Builder . 4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder \u2139\ufe0f This section is recommended but optional. If you do not want to perform this section and use the existing teamspace template, please proceed to section 4.1.2 Teamspace Builder . This section covers the creation of a teamspace template using the teamspace template builder. The use of teamspace templates allows for the configuration of the folder hierarchy, documents, search templates, and security in a user-friendly wizard interface which can then be used to create teamspaces in a timely, secure and consistent manner. 1. From the navigation menu, click on Teamspaces 2. Click on the Templates tab and then click on New Template As shown in the diagram below, the Teamspace Template Builder is displayed. The teamspace template builder uses a wizard-driven user interface that guides you through the following steps: - Define Teamspace Template - Select Searches - Select Classes or Entry Templates - Folders and Documents Tree - Select Roles 3. Teamspace Template Builder - Define Teamspace Template Enter a value for the Template name and Template description . If you are using a shared environment and plan to share the template, please select a value that distinguishes your template from others. In the diagram below, a generic template name and description is used for the employee onboarding use case and specified not to share the template. At this point, you can continue to the next step by clicking on the Next button for the remaining configuration items (searches, classes/entry templates, folders/documents and roles). At any point, you can complete the configuration of the template by clicking on the Finish button and optionally edit the configuration at a later time. When complete, click on the Next button to continue to the next step. 4. Teamspace Template Builder - Select Searches You will not specify any searches for the teamspace, click the Next button to continue to the next step 5. Teamspace Template Builder - Select Classes or Entry Templates This step specifies either document classes or entry templates that can be used to store documents into the teamspace. You will configure this step using classes. As shown in the diagram below, first click the option for Use classes to add documents . Select the Employment Application and the Document classes and click the Add button. Finally, click on the Next button to continue to the next step. \u2139\ufe0f If the Employment Application class is not available, please contact your Administrator to make it available to you.

Teamspaces represent a focused view of the relevant folders, documents and searches that a team needs to complete their tasks. Our use case revolves around Lucy reviewing an existing teamspace for employee applicant John Doe. Typicaly, the teamspace would already be created, processed and reviewed by a few HR processors before reaching Lucy to further review and approve the applicant for onboarding. In this section, you first create an employee onboarding teamspace for the employee applicant John Doe. Next, you will review how a teamspace is used once it is created. 4.1 - Create Teamspace An Employee Onboarding teamspace template should already be available. If not or if you want to learn more about creating teamspace templates, please proceed to the section below - 4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder . Otherwise, proceed to section 4.1.2 - Teamspace Builder . 4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder \u2139\ufe0f This section is recommended but optional. If you do not want to perform this section and use the existing teamspace template, please proceed to section 4.1.2 Teamspace Builder . This section covers the creation of a teamspace template using the teamspace template builder. The use of teamspace templates allows for the configuration of the folder hierarchy, documents, search templates, and security in a user-friendly wizard interface which can then be used to create teamspaces in a timely, secure and consistent manner. 1. From the navigation menu, click on Teamspaces 2. Click on the Templates tab and then click on New Template As shown in the diagram below, the Teamspace Template Builder is displayed.

Teamspace Template Builder - Define Teamspace Template Enter a value for the Template name and Template description . If you are using a shared environment and plan to share the template, please select a value that distinguishes your template from others. In the diagram below, a generic template name and description is used for the employee onboarding use case and specified not to share the template. At this point, you can continue to the next step by clicking on the Next button for the remaining configuration items (searches, classes/entry templates, folders/documents and roles). At any point, you can complete the configuration of the template by clicking on the Finish button and optionally edit the configuration at a later time.

Focus Corp Demos Dashboard Reviewing the Focus Corp Demos Dashboard we see a text summary describing the demo, a discovery map diagram and a flow diagram for our reference. OK, let's launch the demo... Customer refund requests We start by becoming the customer. From the Focus Corp Your Returns and Refunds portal, we select one of our recent orders and submit a return. The result is approved with an expected date to receive funds. We select and submit another order for refund but before we submit, let's take a peak behind the form at some of the business rules. A few of the fields are used by a set of business rules to make the refund decision and we see those here. This refund request results in a denial but it is still straight through processing without any manual work. Upon selecting a final, third order, the rules this time are not certain and send the refund request off to a human queue for manual investigation. This bottom investigation branch of the straight through process can utilize significant resources. Operations week 1 A few manual refunds are not a problem for the team, but too many will cause delays and our customer satisfaction will go down. The Operations Specialist reviews the Refund Dashboard, powered by Business Automation Insights and see not only the percentage of manually processed requests is high at more than 67% but the average manual investigation time across all requests is more than 2 hours. They pass their findings to the Rule Manager to take action. Rules manager As a rules manager, we have access to the decision model behind our refund process. The data is passed from the process system to the rules in the form of an order and refund request. This moves through various decision tables including a time window validation that deals with the return reason, the days since delivery and the condition of the goods. In combination, these lead to various processing decisions and we see a few that result in manual processing listed. Another decision table deals with the type of goods and may also result in some manual processing. Finally, this is then combined with a simple text rule to make the final decision. The rules manager drafted up a new branch of the decision model with some updates, let's take a look. To reduce manual processing, the rules manager adjusted the tables to remove some of the manual processing decisions. Comparing the two versions shows that row 3 column 3 moved from manual to denied, for example. Other rows were removed which results in an default approved decision. We could also test and simulate the rule changes and compare historical results but we won't cover that here in this demo. Customer manual to approved After the Rules Manager deploys the new rules, let go back to being a customer and try them out. Submitting the same order as before which resulted in a manual result now is approved! Operations week After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist sees some solid improvement with a reduction in half for manual requests and also lower manual processing time average from above 120, down to only 60 mins. Use Case Summary With combined workflow and decision automation, both capabilities within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, and updated business rules, we reduce the manual processing queues significantly Increased straight through processing results in lower average completion time, lower costs, and more consistent communication with the customer throughout the process.

Summary \u00b6 Expand to view As you saw, Workstream Services helps you manage remote work more effectively by allowing business users to create lightweight workflows that automate internal processes, no coding required. Get ready to improve your team's productivity by simplifying common tasks and decreasing the complexity and limitations of remote work. Go to top | Go to Getting Started Lab Full Demo Narration \u00b6 Expand to view Intro Working in a remote environment adds complexity to most tasks. Imagine you lead a shared services team and receive requests from other departments such as Accounts Payable or HR. In person, it's simple to collect information and share status. However, in a remote environment, organizing work is more challenging. Relying on email and phone is just not enough. Work can be duplicated or executed inconsistently, resulting in lost data and delays. You need a lightweight workflow to manage incoming requests. Demo Start Page After reviewing the demo launch page including the outline and discovery map, we are ready to launch the Line of Business Supervisor's Workplace interface, the single place you manage all your work. Manage workstream teams You check out the start workflow list and see great starting activities and workflows such as approval, checklist and more. You start by managing the teams. It's a good idea to add yourself to at least Administrators and Supervisors and maybe Team managers. You can also create a Shared Services team so you can assign work to them later. Create a workstream Now it's time to create a workstream for incoming shared services requests. We'll set it so everyone can start and give a description. The simple, no-code editor allows you to assemble a workflow in just a few clicks. Start with a checklist activity to represent the skill profile requested. To make this reusable, we add checklist items with placeholders and allow the user that launches the flow to update and add more. Let's also add a couple data items for the country and date available. Once the request is submitted, the shared services team member will complete this form and confirm their skills. Your first activity is complete! We add another step to get manager approval and setup a simple branch flow. For the approval branch we add a form to notify of the result. Then, head back to our approval and add the rejection branch. So simple! To complete the workstream, we save and we're ready to go. Test a workstream The new flow starts in trial mode for the author or a testing group to try it out safely before the end users. Simple to test, we see the launch screen specific to this workstream where the user starting the flow, such as an Accounts Payable clerk, will configure available options including checklist items, and also any activity assignments allowed by the workstream, which we did not activate yet. Once started, we go back to the main Workplace. Let's take on the role of a shared services team member and see how easy it is to complete the first step. Claim and open the task, check the checklist items, fill in the data, optionally attach a document for review, type a comment and submit. This is much easier and more organized than email. Now taking on my team manager role for approval, all looks good and I accept. Finally, the original requestor receives an approval notification to complete the request. Back at the task list we can switch to workflows and without any customization, the tool provides a complete audit trail of all work by default. Publish a workstream Once ready, I can request a publish to share my workstream with other teams. The platform has a built-in approval workstream for workstreams! So we head to the same task list, click to review the workstream definition. As a publisher, I may send it back with comments or publish directly. And in just a few minutes, I created, tested and published a new, lightweight workflow available to anyone in my organization: ready to launch!
