We welcome your collaboration & contributions happily, as our reference applications are meant to reflect your real world scenarios. There are multiple ways to contribute: report bugs and improvement suggestions, improve documentation, and contribute code. Bug reports, documentation changes, and feature requests \u00b6 If you would like to contribute your experience with an IBM Cloud Architecture project back to the project in the form of encountered bug reports, necessary documentation changes, or new feature requests, this can be done through the use of the repository's Issues list. Before opening a new issue, please reference the existing list to make sure a similar or duplicate item does not already exist. Otherwise, please be as explicit as possible when creating the new item and be sure to include the following: Bug reports Specific Project Version Deployment environment A minimal, but complete, setup of steps to recreate the problem Documentation changes URL to existing incorrect or incomplete documentation (either in the project's GitHub repo or external product documentation) Updates required to correct current inconsistency If possible, a link to a project fork, sample, or workflow to expose the gap in documentation. Feature requests Complete description of project feature request, including but not limited to, components of the existing project that are impacted, as well as additional components that may need to be created. A minimal, but complete, setup of steps to recreate environment necessary to identify the new feature's current gap. The more explicit and thorough you are in opening GitHub Issues, the more efficient your interaction with the maintainers will be. When creating the GitHub Issue for your bug report, documentation change, or feature request, be sure to add as many relevant labels as necessary (that are defined for that specific project). These will vary by project, but will be helpful to the maintainers in quickly triaging your new GitHub issues. Code contributions \u00b6 We really value contributions, and to maximize the impact of code contributions, we request that any contributions follow the guidelines below. If you are new to open source contribution and would like some more pointers or guidance, you may want to check out Your First PR and First Timers Only . These are a few projects that help on-board new contributors to the overall process. Coding and Pull Requests best practices \u00b6 Please ensure you follow the coding standard and code formatting used throughout the existing code base. This may vary project by project, but any specific diversion from normal language standards will be explicitly noted. One feature / bug fix / documentation update per pull request Always pull the latest changes from upstream and rebase before creating any pull request. New pull requests should be created against the integration branch of the repository, if available. This ensures new code is included in full-stack integration tests before being merged into the master branch All new features must be accompanied by associated tests. Make sure all tests pass locally before submitting a pull request. Include tests with every feature enhancement, improve tests with every bug fix Github and git flow \u00b6 The internet is littered with guides and information on how to use and understand git. However, here's a compact guide that follows the suggested workflow Fork the desired repo in github. Clone your repo to your local computer. Add the upstream repository Note: Guide for step 1-3 here: forking a repo Create new development branch off the targeted upstream branch. This will often be master . git checkout -b <my-feature-branch> master Do your work: Write your code Write your tests Pass your tests locally Commit your intermediate changes as you go and as appropriate Repeat until satisfied Fetch latest upstream changes (in case other changes had been delivered upstream while you were developing your new feature). git fetch upstream Rebase to the latest upstream changes, resolving any conflicts.

Push the changes to your repository git push origin <my-feature-branch> Create a pull request against the same targeted upstream branch. Creating a pull request Once the pull request has been reviewed, accepted and merged into the main github repository, you should synchronise your remote and local forked github repository master branch with the upstream master branch. To do so: Pull to your local forked repository the latest changes upstream (that is, the pull request). git pull upstream master Push those latest upstream changes pulled locally to your remote forked repository. git push origin master What happens next? \u00b6 All pull requests will be automatically built and unit tested by travis-ci, when implemented by that specific project. You can determine if a given project is enabled for travis-ci unit tests by the existence of a .travis.yml file in the root of the repository or branch. When in use, all travis-ci unit tests must pass completely before any further review or discussion takes place. The repository maintainer will then inspect the commit and, if accepted, will pull the code into the upstream branch.

It is based from Hafedh Mili and Jerome Boyer's book . The content is product agnostic and support incremental and iterative development for decision services. It starts from a business operation improvement idea that is assessed versus of set of criteria to validate the fit to use a Business Rule Management System, and then addresses all the project implementation tasks. Goals \u00b6 ABRD applies the agile manifesto to efficiently implement business policies as executable rules. The goal is not having a team spending month to document thousand of rules, where those rules can be implemented, executed, tested in less time, even as early as the first day of your analysis. The goals can be summarized as: Separate rules as a manageable artifact using discovery, analysis and authoring activities and work products Trace rules during their full life cycle from requirement to deployment and maintenance Link rules to business context and motivation Develop the rule description using business terms and high level rule language Prepare the fact model for the rule implementation Prepare the rule set implementation and deployment as decision services in a Service Oriented Architecture or as Micro Services executed by a rule engine Articulate the rule governance processes Concepts \u00b6 To get a good understanding of business rules, rule engines and other terms used in this content, see this note How to Adopt ABRD \u00b6 BRMS enable managing business rule as a standalone artifact, owned by the business user, and maintainable over time into production system. The implementation of a business rule application follows some activities and tasks that are slightly different than traditional software development life cycle. The integration of one or more business analysts as part of the development team is also less traditional. Finally the core value of such technology is to be able to have business user maintaining the business rules in production with a minimum involvement of IT. Technology is one side of the coin, methodology and best practices is the other. A Project Management Office can leverage ABRD as-is or integrate it as content for their own methodology. If the team is new to business rule application, it is best to start with a small rule set and incrementally add rules and best practices over time. The team has to integrate the rule discovery and analysis activities in their own project plan. Prototyping or Minimum Viable Product is a major approach, as it shows to the team concrete execution, and helps to drive issues, and requirements around business rules and even business process. Common Pitfalls \u00b6 The most common pitfalls in implementing business rules application include: * Starting by harvesting all the rules in a document without any implementation * Ignoring the importance of the data model * Not understanding where the rules are (should be) enforced * Mixing the data model from the implementation point of view, with the domain model that is used by the business * Involving IT only: never forget the business, involve them as early as possible and make them take ownership of the rules. * Outsourcing business rule implementation: business rules are enterprise assets. * Forgetting to test the rules outside of the application * Not involving the business in the rule validation process * Badly designing a rule set, by not applying standard design pattern as separation of concerns. Incremental Development \u00b6 The following diagram illustrates how a decision service implementation is built from a business idea to an executable SOA service integrated with a BPM system or any consumers. Within those phases we can find project activities that are executed multiple times during each phase: Rule discovery Rule analysis Fact model implementation Rule implementation and unit test Rule validation Rule deployment Like all agile methodologies, ABRD prescribes an incremental development using time boxed iterations. However, in ABRD, the entire process lifecycle may not be followed for each iteration. Instead, a number of very short cycles between phases may occur, with the entire ruleset gradually evolving. Using a business rule management platform enables managing business rule as a standalone artifact, owned by the business user, and maintainable by them directly time into production system. The implementation of a business rule application follows some activities and tasks that are slightly different than traditional software development life cycle. The strong involvement of one or more business rule analysts as part of the development team is recommended to harvest the rule while they are implemented. Technology is one side of the coin, methodology and best practices is the other. Executing a project to implement a solution using rule engine and a BRMS follows the following progression as illustrated A Project Management Office can leverage ABRD as-is and integrate it within their own methodology or tailor it by injecting their own practices. As open source you can also contribute to it. If the team is new to business rule application, it is best to start with a small rule set and incrementally add rules and best practices over time. The team has to integrate the rule discovery and analysis activities in their own project plan.

Outsourcing business rule implementation: business rules are enterprise assets. Forgetting to test the rules outside of the application Not involving the business in the rule validation process Badly designing a rule set, by not applying standard design pattern as separation of concerns.

However, in ABRD, the entire process lifecycle may not be followed for each iteration. Instead, a number of very short cycles between phases may occur, with the entire ruleset gradually evolving. The entire process may be represented by the diagram below: In the process flow diagram above, each of the task loops back to previous task in the flow. These 'loops', or cycles, are repeated as required, with the loops gradually moving from left to right through the process until the rule sets are deployed to production environment. This method of rule development reflects the nature of BRMS: a mature and stable domain object model is a prerequisite for rule development, therefore we may multiply cycles through the early part of the process flow in order to develop such models early in the process. As each of these cycles is completed, the ruleset will gradually grow until it reaches a state where it reflects the requirements set forth by the business. The phases and activities apply for both operational, inference business rules as event processing rules. The event processing rule will, most likely require different technologies: a BRMS and a CEP platform, but the development methodology is similar. A typical ABRD Project \u00b6 From a project management perspective, there are four phases, each of which maps onto parts of the technical process flow described above. The project phases are: Harvesting, the activity of gathering business rules Foundation, the activity of defining the decision service interface, to develop the domain specific data model: the Rule Business Object, to implement the different business rule pattern into the BRMS, develop the unit tests Building, the activity of building a working decision service, representing the organizations business rules, it includes integration with the decision service consumers or the event producers and any reference data management sources. Enhancement groups completing the business logic by adding more rules, and start the rule governance process, the decision logic monitoring, and maintaining and enhancing business rules. This specific phase should be done with less involvement from IT, and with modern BRMS, business analysts can support the full cycle of authoring rules, validating them, and hot deploy to production. Cycle 1- Harvesting \u00b6 Rule harvesting, consisting of the Discovery & Analysis tasks, involves gathering together all the sources of knowledge available to the team. These sources may include a business process description, subject matter experts, policy manuals, existing code or other sources of rules. The goal of this activity is to understand the Domain Object Model within the scope of the application and to identify enough rule patterns to begin implementation of rules in the next phase. During this activity, the development teams divide the day into two parts, executing discovery workshops in the morning (in 2 or 3-hour session), then performing analysis and documentation for the remainder of the day. The team iterates on these two steps during 2 to 5 days maximum, depending on the number of rule pattern and their complexity. The starting point of the Rule Discovery is a Decision Point Table artifact: During the inception phase (See OpenUP for more information) the project team is doing business modeling activities (not covered here) which aim at describing the business process and decisions applied to any business events supported by the application. One important work product built during this modeling phase is the Decision Point Table which describes the point in the process (task, activities, transition) where decisions are made. Decision point represents potential candidate for rule sets. Cycle 2- Building Foundations \u00b6 The building foundation extends the tasks performed during harvesting to include rule business object implementation and rule authoring. When a workable number of rules (this number will vary by project) have been harvested the development team should start to define the structure of the rule project: the decision service interface, the rule set variables (input-output business objects), the basic sequencing of the rules (the Rule Flow), and the major elements of the Business Object Model. The team should then be able to implement and unit test some rules. A best practice is to execute the step \"Rule Authoring\" as soon as possible to uncover possible analysis and design issues. Indeed, most of the rules look good on paper but real issues will surface during implementation and test. The next morning workshop session the rule developer should communicate the issues back to the business team to quickly address the change to the business logic. This leverages the feedback loop approach and provides an efficient mechanism to build a pragmatic, adequate and business-relevant executable rule set. Cycle 3- Building \u00b6 The goal of the build phase is to create rules that can be 'seen', 'used' and, most importantly, tested, by business users. Rules that can be executed by the rule engine are more valuable than ones defined on paper or in abstract forms. This fully endorses the agile statement:\"Working software over comprehensive documentation.\" The second goal of this phase is to create a set of realistic test scenarios, using real data when possible, to test the rules created during the Authoring activity. This is a form of Test Driven Development (TDD). This activity extends the Build activity by adding a Rule Validation task. The day-to-day authoring activities consist of a series of small steps that include: * Test case implementation * Writing rules and executing rules * Validating rules with the business team members * Deploy automatically to the target test platform so decision services are consumable The build activity consists of all the previous tasks, with short iterations: * Enhance rules (Authoring & Validation tasks) * Improve rules (Analysis, Authoring & Validation) as needs are identified * Complement rules (Discovery, Analysis, Authoring & Validation) with additional rules to provide complete coverage of the business domain (once every two days). The Building activity should take between two and three weeks iteration, and the output artifacts should be a ruleset that can be loaded into the rule engine and executed. Checkpoint: During the first iteration of this activity , the total number of rules will be only around 40 % to 60 % completed . The idea is to get something to business users that is sufficient to get comments and feedbacks on , and that will form the basis of the next phase . By this point , the Rule Business Object Model ( RBO ) should be at least 90 % complete . Depending on the size of the ruleset, this activity may deliver less than 40% of the rules. In that case, this activity may have to be repeated. In this situation, it is recommended that the activity be time-boxed from two to three weeks maximum so that a concrete build may be delivered to the validation team for functional verification, integration test and non regression testing. Once a build is delivered, another iteration of this cycle may be started. As soon as the decision service interface is stable, or the event structure is well defines the development team should be able to deploy the rule set under construction to the execution server in order to test it with an end-to-end scenario. The integration of the decision service and the domain object model is an important task. Integration involves the marshaling of data to/from external data sources, transform it to the rule business object model view so it can be understood by the execution engine. This is 'mapping' of the data to the Rule Business Object Model created in previous activities is very important as it is a very bad practice to take an existing enterprise model, or a canonical model to be the foundation of the rule processing. Too much genericity and complexity will impact rule adoption by the business users, and knowledge transfer between developers too. There are a number of tools and techniques that can be used to marshal data, and the best choice will vary depending of the technologies available: ESB, micro services, ETL, batch processing, event based processing.... When this activity is completed, data (preferably 'real' data) will be sent to the rule engine to fire rules, make decision and the results delivered over the same channels as the production system. The test scenarios developed in previous phases, are run with all of the 'plumbing' in place. In the future they will serve as non-regression test suite. Cycle 4- Enhancing \u00b6 Cycle 4 is used during the development phase as well as during the rule maintenance or governance activity post production deployment. One of the goal here is to empower business users or at least business analysts to author and test the rules. The Enhancing cycle is a transition phase in which last minute changes can be made involving some short, face to face discovery meetings with SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) to wrap up any outstanding issues or questions before entering the Governance activity. The Governance activity is an open-ended, long running process to enhance and maintain the rules created in previous activities. A governance process will vary by organization and is a fundamentally different SDLC process, usually performed by a different team than the rule development team. This team is more business oriented and, as owners of the rules and business policies, they can develop at their own pace, using the infrastructure put in place by the development team. It is important to note that there will almost certainly be some need to enhance the rule business object model to add some new facts, attributes, or entities. These modifications should follow the standard release management process of the core business application using continuous build and delivery.","title":"Agile Business Rules Development Methodology"},{"location":"methodology/abrd/#introduction","text":"The Agile Business Rule Methodology was developed in 2004 at ILOG and then used on hundred of projects worldwide when projects need to integrate decision management into the business application.

From a business perspective, a business rule is a precise statement that describes, constrains, or controls some aspect of the business. Let's illustrate this concept with a simple example coming from the lending industry. The following business policy can be established to limit the loan amount a bank can purchase: Only prime loans are eligible for purchase This policy may be split into two implemented rules, one defining what a prime loan is and the second taking the decision on purchasing it or not. If the loan amount is less than the prime loan limit , then the loan type is Prime If the loan type is not Prime then reject the loan Implementing these rules using an Object Oriented Language may look like two if statements testing conditions on objects, and applying actions on the same or other objects if ( loan . amount < PrimeLoanLimit ) { loan . type = PrimeType ; } if ( loan . type != PrimeType ) { case = new Case ( \"Loan is not Prime\" ); loan . status = REJECT ; } The concept of business rules is not new, and for decades analysts and developers were implementing them within business applications. Since the introduction of a Business Rule Management System application, early 2000, which provides tools to manage the rule as a standalone element, outside of the core business application, and in a form which is executable by a rule engine. Business rules are packaged as a Rule Set which can be considered as a piece of software executed by a rule engine. Integrated in a business application, the rule set implements a sub-set of the business logic. This logic is externalized from the traditional code and can be easily changed, and maintained by business analysts instead of developers. As opposed to business logic embedded and hidden in functions, procedures, macros or databases, business rules are clearly separated from the rule engine, a software component which executes and activates rules based on matching conditions on a set of data. Figure 1 below illustrates this fundamental approach in implementing business logic, with the old embedded model on the left and the new architecture on the right. In many ways the approach is similar to the separation of code and data which Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) brought in the 1970s. A piece of business logic or rule embedded in code will be more difficult to identify, locate, and change, therefore increases costs of maintenance. A rule which is externalized in a BRMS platform, and whose versions are controlled in a rule repository and deployed and executed in a rule engine, will be much easier to modify, thus reducing dramatically the time and cost to implement changes required by the business. Traditional software life cycles such as the V cycle or waterfall model are notorious for leading to systems which costs more than expected, come to market later than planned and with outcomes not matching the clients' initial expectations. With such approaches, the business users have little ownership of the solution, and the time required to implement changes can easily range from 3 to 6 months if not more. As a result, policy owners don't feel comfortable with change which translates into a loss of agility to respond to new business and competitive situations: too much time passes between policy owners submitting requirements to IT and the actual deployment of new rules. Also, with all the fine tuning and iterations, policy owners cannot really be sure that the policy is being implemented according to their needs. The only way to actually know is to keep performing tests and hope that all the cases are covered in such tests. As important element of the business decision, the business rules need strong management processes and tools to support their life cycle. A BRMS provides solutions to make this management more efficient, both for developers and for the business users of the applications. Obviously tooling is not the single answer to the software and business challenges behind the development of decision-support systems. Deploying BRMS, BRE, and BPM components into business applications requires to modify current development methodologies and practices in order to take into account new concepts as well as providing a better collaboration framework between IT and business. The Agile Business Rule Development methodology corresponds to such a need. It is an incremental and iterative software development process leveraging the Agile Alliance manifesto (Agile Manifesto). Here are some of the Agile development values particularly relevant to the implementation of a rule set using the ABRD approach: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. The rule discovery, analysis and validation activities require an active and efficient communication between the rule developer and the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Such processes are defined as light as possible. Working software over comprehensive documentation. The proposed rule set development done per iteration, with its validation step, is based on the evidence that a working and executable rule set has much more business value than a rule description manual. All the project stakeholders benefit from such a principle but in particular the business users who are then sure that what they see (the rules) is what gets executed in the deployed system. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Subject Matter Experts who define the business policies and the business rules are strongly involved in the development process. They are the customers of the final system, owners of the policies and are conveniently co-located with the development team during the project. Responding to change over following a plan. Business rules evolve, more often and faster than other standard pieces of software. This is actually one of the key values of the business rule approach. For this fundamental reason the methodology to support the rule set development has to be tailored to such rapid life cycle and include the appropriate activities, processes, best practices and work products to support such changes efficiently. Two fundamental drivers govern successful rule set developments: The unforgiving honesty of executable rules The effectiveness of people working together with goodwill, shared vision and common interests (the business user and the development team). Executable or working rules tell the developers and the Subject Matter Expert what they really do as opposed to promise through a paper-based design or specification. Rule Engine \u00b6 Software component used to execute business rule. The rule engine uses two major entities: a Ruleset: The set of rules that are processed by the rule engine, and rule execution flow information. an object set: The set of objects to be treated by rules. A rule engine is executing a cycle consisting of three action states: match rules, select rules, and execute rules until there is no more rule to execute. The rule engine evaluates the conditions of rules in the ruleset against the objects to determine (match) which rules are eligible to be executed. During execution, the engine collects all eligible rules in an \u201cagenda\u201d. The object set is referenced in the engine\u2019s working memory, which also contains the current state of the objects which lead to the current rules in the agenda. All objects are examined by all rules. The effects of the execution are to create new data, or to modify existing ones. The agenda is a logical workspace where rule instances that have conditions matching objects in the working memory are put. There can be several rule instances for the same rule. When all the candidate rule are matched the engine turns to the agenda for rule execution. One execution mode is the RetePlus algorithm used to match many patterns with many objects, it helps to minimize the number of rules and conditions that need to be evaluated, computes which rules should be executed, and identifies in which order these rules should be fired. Rules engine is designed to be complete, and ensures that the effects of one rule execution (or firing) is propagated so that everything that can be inferred is done in one run. The power of rule engines comes from the fact that complex behaviors result from simple rules, this is known as rule chaining. This is a major change in the programming model developer used to have.There is no more static control structure of the program where function is calling one another, rules are \u201ccommunicating\u201d with other rule only by way of the data. This is a data change that trigger potential rule execution. Rules are not executed sequentially and it is not always possible to determine through inspection of a set of rules which rule will be executed first or cause the inference engine to terminate. Business Rule Analyst \u00b6 The Business Rule Analyst is a special kind of business analyst with a strong knowledge of how a business rule applications are developed. In his day-to-day work, he helps the business team turning business policy into rules, but also helps to clearly define the business view, or fact model, for developers to implement. He is a bridge between the business side and technical side of an application, translating business policies into a formal specifications (model) for developers, then validates it with the different business managers. With the IT developer, he shares the vocabulary definition used in rules, then captures, writes, and organizes the business logic into business rules. His responsibilities include: Identify business sponsors for issues relating to business rules. Articulate the benefits of implementing a decision management solution with Operational Decision Manager Identify the key user roles that are involved in designing and developing a decision manager solution, and the tasks that are associated with each role Establish and maintain traceability from the business policies to the executable business rules. Assist business in identifying existing business rules. Research the meaning and origin of the business rules Create rule templates for rule writers and analyst Analyze rules for completeness, correctness, optimization (from a logical, not performance perspective) Identify how rules are used in processes that implement business policies Ensure the quality of the business rules Ensure that consistent terminology is used in the business rules in order to build a common vocabulary and a domain data model Analyze business rules to identify conflicts, redundancies Ensure consistency of business rules across functions, geographies and systems Conduct impact analysis for revision or replacement of business rules Integrate new or revised rules into existing rule set Make recommendations for business rule changes based on business knowledge Facilitate resolution of business rules issues Act as consultant for the project team Act as a liaison between business and IT Skills \u00b6 The Business Rule Analyst is responsible for putting in place the rule approach and the rule stewardship. He is responsible for the execution of the ABRD process, and helps extract and write the business rules. Competency includes: Object-oriented analysis and design Java development: light to medium skilled, Java Bean programming at a minimum Rule programming: inference, rule chaining, pattern matching, working memory and agenda Understanding of the different rule engine algorithm ABRD: rule discovery and rule analysis practices Decision Validation Services to validate business requirement for each decision service. Rule Governance Familiarity with the Decision Model Notation (DMN) Decision Management System \u00b6 Used to be named Business Rule Management System, Decision management system designed to modify and manage business logic independently from the enterprise application. A BRMS provides a way to automate decision making and execute precisely on business policy. Consequently, policies and decisions form the core of all business processes and activities. A BRMS platform should include facilities to enable: Full life-cycle maintenance of business rules by business analysts and developers Assured consistency by representing business knowledge uniformly with centralized control Facilities for testing, scenario generation, and impact analysis BRMS is a method and means to treat rules as a true corporate asset. Agile Estimation \u00b6 There are three main concepts you need to understand to do agile estimation: Estimation of Size gives a high-level estimate for the work item, typically measured using a neutral unit such as points Velocity tells us how many points this project team can deliver within an iteration; Estimation of Effort translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. The estimation of effort indicates how long it will take the team member(s) to complete the assigned work item(s). Estimation of Size \u00b6 Points is a relative measure that can be used for agile estimation of size. The team decides how big a point is, and based on that size, determines how many points each work item is. To make estimation go fast, use only full points, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, rather than fractions of a point, such 0.25, or 1.65 points. To get started, look at 10 or so representative work items, give the smallest the size of one point, and then go through all other work items and give them a relative point estimate based on that point. Note that points are used for high-level estimates, so do not spend too much time on any one item. This is especially true for work items of lower priority, to avoid wasting effort on things that are unlikely to be addressed within the current iteration. A key benefit of points is that they are neutral and relative. Let\u2019s say that Ann is 3 times more productive than Jack. If Ann and Jack agree that work item A is worth 1 point, and they both think work item B is roughly 5 times as big, they can rapidly agree that work item B is worth 5 points. Ann may however think work item B can be done in 12 hours, while Jack thinks it can be done in 36 hours. That is fine, they may disagree about the actual effort required to do it, but we do not care at this point in time, we only want the team to agree on the relative size. We will later use Velocity to determine how much \u2018size\u2019, or how many points, the team can take on within an iteration. One project team may say that a work item of a certain size is worth 1 point. Another project team would estimate the same sized work item to be worth 5 points. That is fine, as long as you are consistent within the same project. Make sure that the entire team is involved in assessing size, or at least that the same people are involved in all your size estimates, to ensure consistency within your project. We will see how the concept of velocity will fix also this discrepancy in a point meaning different things to different project teams. You can also use other measures of size, where the most common alternative is Ideal Days. Velocity \u00b6 Velocity is a key metric used for iteration planning. It indicates how many points are delivered upon within an iteration for a certain team and project. As an example, a team planned to accomplish 20 points in the first iteration. At the end of the iteration, they noticed that they only delivered upon 14 points, their velocity was hence 14. For the next iteration, they may plan for fewer points, let\u2019s say 18 points, since they think they can do a little better than in previous iteration. In this iteration, they delivered 17 points, giving them a velocity of 17. Expect the velocity to change from iteration to iteration. Some iterations go smoother than others, and points are not always identical in terms of effort. Some team members are more effective than others, and some problems end up being harder than others. Also, changes to the team structure, learning new skills, changes to the tool environment, better teaming, or more overhead with meetings or tasks external to the project will all impact velocity. In general, velocity typically increases during the project as the team builds skills and becomes more cohesive. Velocity compensates for differences between teams in terms of how big a point is. Let\u2019s assume that project team Alpha and project team Beta are equally efficient in developing software, and they run the same project in parallel. Team Alpha, however, assesses all work items as being worth 3 times as many points as team Beta's estimates. Team Alpha assesses work item A, B, C, and D to correspond to 30 points, and team Beta estimates the same work items to correspond to 10 points. Both teams deliver upon those 4 work items in the next iteration, giving team Alpha a velocity of 30, and team Beta a velocity of 10. It may sound as if team Alpha is more effective, but let\u2019s look at what happens when they plan the next iteration. They both want to take on work item E-H, which team Alpha has estimated to be 30 points, and team Beta as normal has estimated to be \u2153 as many points, or 10 points. Since a team can typically take on as many points as indicated by their velocity, they can both take on all of E-H. The end result is that it does not matter how big a point is, as long as you are consistent within your team. Velocity also averages out the efficiency of different team members. Let\u2019s look at an example; Let\u2019s assume that Ann always works 3 times as fast as Jack and Jane. Ann will perhaps deliver 9 points per iteration, and Jack and Jane 3 points each per iteration. The velocity of that 3-person team will be 15 points. As mentioned above, Ann and Jack may not agree on how much effort is associated with a work item, but they can agree on how many points it is worth. Since the team velocity is 15, the velocity will automatically translate the point estimate to how much work can be taken on. As you switch team members, or as team members become more or less efficient, your velocity will change, and you can hence take on more or less points. This does however not require you to change the estimate of the size. The size is still the same, and the velocity will help you to calculate how much size you can deliver upon with the team at hand for that iteration. Estimation of Effort \u00b6 Estimation of Effort translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. As you plan an iteration, you will take on a work item, such as detail, design, implement and test a scenario, which may be sized to 5 points. Since this is still a reasonably big work item, break it down into a number of smaller work items, such as 4 separate work items for Detailing, Designing, Implementing and Testing Server portion, and Implementing and Testing Client portion of the scenario. Team members are asked to sign up for the tasks, and then detail the estimate of the actual effort, measured in hours or days, for their tasks. In this case, the following actual estimates were done (with person responsible within parenthesis): Detailing scenario (Ann): 4 hours Designing scenario (Ann and Jack): 6 hours Implementing and Testing Server portion of scenario (Jack): 22 hours Implementing and Testing Client portion of scenario (Ann): 12 hours Total Effort Estimate for Scenario: 44 hours If other people would be assigned to the tasks, the estimated actual hours could be quite different. There is hence no point doing detailed estimates until you know who will do the work, and what actual problems you will run into. Often, some level of analysis and design of the work item needs to take place before a reasonable estimate can be done. Remember that estimates are still estimates, and a person assigned to a task should feel free (and be encouraged) to re-estimate the effort required to complete the task, so we have a realistic view of progress within an iteration.","title":"Business Rules Related Concepts"},{"location":"methodology/abrd/concepts/#business-rule","text":"Business rules are an expression of business policy in a form that is both comprehensible to business users and executable by a rule engine. From a business perspective, a business rule is a precise statement that describes, constrains, or controls some aspect of the business. Let's illustrate this concept with a simple example coming from the lending industry. The following business policy can be established to limit the loan amount a bank can purchase: Only prime loans are eligible for purchase This policy may be split into two implemented rules, one defining what a prime loan is and the second taking the decision on purchasing it or not. If the loan amount is less than the prime loan limit , then the loan type is Prime If the loan type is not Prime then reject the loan Implementing these rules using an Object Oriented Language may look like two if statements testing conditions on objects, and applying actions on the same or other objects if ( loan . amount < PrimeLoanLimit ) { loan . type = PrimeType ; } if ( loan . type != PrimeType ) { case = new Case ( \"Loan is not Prime\" ); loan . status = REJECT ; } The concept of business rules is not new, and for decades analysts and developers were implementing them within business applications. Since the introduction of a Business Rule Management System application, early 2000, which provides tools to manage the rule as a standalone element, outside of the core business application, and in a form which is executable by a rule engine. Business rules are packaged as a Rule Set which can be considered as a piece of software executed by a rule engine. Integrated in a business application, the rule set implements a sub-set of the business logic. This logic is externalized from the traditional code and can be easily changed, and maintained by business analysts instead of developers. As opposed to business logic embedded and hidden in functions, procedures, macros or databases, business rules are clearly separated from the rule engine, a software component which executes and activates rules based on matching conditions on a set of data. Figure 1 below illustrates this fundamental approach in implementing business logic, with the old embedded model on the left and the new architecture on the right. In many ways the approach is similar to the separation of code and data which Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) brought in the 1970s. A piece of business logic or rule embedded in code will be more difficult to identify, locate, and change, therefore increases costs of maintenance. A rule which is externalized in a BRMS platform, and whose versions are controlled in a rule repository and deployed and executed in a rule engine, will be much easier to modify, thus reducing dramatically the time and cost to implement changes required by the business. Traditional software life cycles such as the V cycle or waterfall model are notorious for leading to systems which costs more than expected, come to market later than planned and with outcomes not matching the clients' initial expectations. With such approaches, the business users have little ownership of the solution, and the time required to implement changes can easily range from 3 to 6 months if not more. As a result, policy owners don't feel comfortable with change which translates into a loss of agility to respond to new business and competitive situations: too much time passes between policy owners submitting requirements to IT and the actual deployment of new rules. Also, with all the fine tuning and iterations, policy owners cannot really be sure that the policy is being implemented according to their needs. The only way to actually know is to keep performing tests and hope that all the cases are covered in such tests. As important element of the business decision, the business rules need strong management processes and tools to support their life cycle. A BRMS provides solutions to make this management more efficient, both for developers and for the business users of the applications. Obviously tooling is not the single answer to the software and business challenges behind the development of decision-support systems. Deploying BRMS, BRE, and BPM components into business applications requires to modify current development methodologies and practices in order to take into account new concepts as well as providing a better collaboration framework between IT and business. The Agile Business Rule Development methodology corresponds to such a need. It is an incremental and iterative software development process leveraging the Agile Alliance manifesto (Agile Manifesto). Here are some of the Agile development values particularly relevant to the implementation of a rule set using the ABRD approach: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. The rule discovery, analysis and validation activities require an active and efficient communication between the rule developer and the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Such processes are defined as light as possible. Working software over comprehensive documentation. The proposed rule set development done per iteration, with its validation step, is based on the evidence that a working and executable rule set has much more business value than a rule description manual. All the project stakeholders benefit from such a principle but in particular the business users who are then sure that what they see (the rules) is what gets executed in the deployed system. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Subject Matter Experts who define the business policies and the business rules are strongly involved in the development process. They are the customers of the final system, owners of the policies and are conveniently co-located with the development team during the project. Responding to change over following a plan. Business rules evolve, more often and faster than other standard pieces of software. This is actually one of the key values of the business rule approach. For this fundamental reason the methodology to support the rule set development has to be tailored to such rapid life cycle and include the appropriate activities, processes, best practices and work products to support such changes efficiently. Two fundamental drivers govern successful rule set developments: The unforgiving honesty of executable rules The effectiveness of people working together with goodwill, shared vision and common interests (the business user and the development team). Executable or working rules tell the developers and the Subject Matter Expert what they really do as opposed to promise through a paper-based design or specification.","title":"Business Rule"},{"location":"methodology/abrd/concepts/#rule-engine","text":"Software component used to execute business rule. The rule engine uses two major entities: a Ruleset: The set of rules that are processed by the rule engine, and rule execution flow information. an object set: The set of objects to be treated by rules. A rule engine is executing a cycle consisting of three action states: match rules, select rules, and execute rules until there is no more rule to execute. The rule engine evaluates the conditions of rules in the ruleset against the objects to determine (match) which rules are eligible to be executed. During execution, the engine collects all eligible rules in an \u201cagenda\u201d. The object set is referenced in the engine\u2019s working memory, which also contains the current state of the objects which lead to the current rules in the agenda. All objects are examined by all rules. The effects of the execution are to create new data, or to modify existing ones. The agenda is a logical workspace where rule instances that have conditions matching objects in the working memory are put. There can be several rule instances for the same rule. When all the candidate rule are matched the engine turns to the agenda for rule execution. One execution mode is the RetePlus algorithm used to match many patterns with many objects, it helps to minimize the number of rules and conditions that need to be evaluated, computes which rules should be executed, and identifies in which order these rules should be fired. Rules engine is designed to be complete, and ensures that the effects of one rule execution (or firing) is propagated so that everything that can be inferred is done in one run. The power of rule engines comes from the fact that complex behaviors result from simple rules, this is known as rule chaining. This is a major change in the programming model developer used to have.There is no more static control structure of the program where function is calling one another, rules are \u201ccommunicating\u201d with other rule only by way of the data. This is a data change that trigger potential rule execution. Rules are not executed sequentially and it is not always possible to determine through inspection of a set of rules which rule will be executed first or cause the inference engine to terminate.","title":"Rule Engine"},{"location":"methodology/abrd/concepts/#business-rule-analyst","text":"The Business Rule Analyst is a special kind of business analyst with a strong knowledge of how a business rule applications are developed.

Some older approaches of adopting a unique canonical model, has some advantages and some counter productive ones. With microservice adoption, and applying a domain driven design it is easier to define a bounded context of a microservice, but as soon as you start coding you immediately encounter questions about your information model and what shapes it should have. Canonical model is kept at the messaging or integration layer to do a one to one mapping between model. This note presents the reality view of the different data model to consider. At the end the goal is still to apply clear separation of concern, focus on data needed for implementing business logic, and adapt interface for easy consumption and reuse. The following figure illustrates a potential business automation solution using different components, supported on top of different software products. From Top-Left bottom right: Single Page applications are running in Web Browser and use different javascript library to support HTML rendering, business logic implementation and data model as JSON document. The model view is focusing to expose data to user and to support form entries. The app interacts with one Backend For Frontend app's REST API or other services with CORS support. The model and API are designed for this user centric application. Microservices are exposing model via their APIs, in Java EE, it used to be named Data Transfer Object , and it is still used, named this way in microservice. The focus on this model is to enforce reusability, and expose APIs about the main business entity or aggregate (Domain Driven Design - Aggregate). This entity is persisted in different formats, and when using traditional SQL based technology, Object Relational Mapping is needed. In Java, hibernate ORM is used with JPA to support transaction and entity annotation. Quarkus Panache is a nice way to map business entity transparently to DB. But still we need to design those models. Within the microservice, we will also find specific implementation model used to support the business logic the service implements. The adoption of JSON document to get a more flexible, schemaless model, helps at the technology selection to be more agile as the model can evolve easily, but still we need to think and design such models. Modern business applications are using Artificial Intelligence model. To make it more generic, we defined a predictive scoring service which compute a score between 0 to 1, given a feature set represented as tuples. It does not have to be a predictive scoring and can anything a machine learned model can support, but exposed with an API with flat model. In the middle we have an integration layer: The modern event backbone to support event streaming. The event model is also defined with schema, and any application producing such event, needs to have a specific model to represent fact, of what happens in their boundary. Enterprise service buses are still in scope, as service gateway, interface mapping, and heteregeonous integration is needed. The model definition will better fit to the adoption of canonical model to facilitate the one to one mapping between source and destination models. Those integration can do data mapping with application like CRM, ERP running as system. The name ASBO for application specific business object was used, and it still applies in modern solution. We need to consider them as-is or using mapping. Some business applications need to get human involved, in the form of workflow, where process application implements the workflow and define process variables to keep data between process tasks. Those data are persisted with process instances within the Business Process Management datasource. The business process can be triggered by user interface (claiming to start a process), by exposing a service, in this case we are back to the DTO definition, or triggered asynchronously via messages (back to a message model). Externalizing business rules, is still a relevant pattern, and in the case of decision modeling, a specific data model to support the rules inference and simplify the rule processing is needed. This is what we called Rule Business Object in te agile business rule development methodology. The persisted information model (in system of records or DB) is different than the process variable in BPM, which different than the rule business object model used to make decision. A good architecture leverages different information model views to carry the data to the different layers of the business application: the user interface, the database, the service contract, the business process data, the messaging structure, the events, the business rules, the raw document, the AI scoring input data.... There is nothing new in this, but better to keep that in mind anyway when developing new solutions. The information model for such service has to be designed so there is minimum dependency between consumers and providers. The approach of trying to develop a unique rich information model to support all the different consumers, may lead having the consumers dealing with complex data structure sparsely populated. When defining service specifications it is important to assess if each business entities supported by the service operations is going to have different definitions or if the same definition applies to the whole service portfolio? The scope of reuse of data types is an important architecture decision; there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, a few different patterns are emerging: One object model per interface: Using an independent data model for every service interface assures the highest level of decoupling between services. As negative, the consumers have to understand different representations of the same business entities across multiple services and have to cope with all the relative data transformations. This strategy can be very effective for coarse-grained service operations that do not exchange large amount of data with consumers. One object model per business domain: the service information models are organized in domains, every domain sharing the same data model. The downside of this approach, is once domains are defined, changing their boundaries can be costly. A single object model for the whole enterprise: the approach is to define a single common set of data structures shared across all the enterprise service interfaces. The amount of model customization is kept to a minimum and its management is centralized. The negatives are having overly complicated model the consumers need to process. As of now it becomes a bad practices to adopt such canonical model at the API, persistence and eventing level.","title":"Different Data Models"},{"location":"methodology/overview/","text":"Business automation application development \u00b6 A business process is an interrelated series of activities that convert business inputs into business outputs. A process may execute through many boundaries and controls of existing corporate organizations and departments. Using process automation product to support the design, execution, and monitoring of a business process involves starting on the good track with a strong methodology. One of the key values of the business process automation is to enable organizations to cope with the pace of change. For this fundamental reason, the methodology to support the process development has to be tailored to such rapid life cycle and to include the appropriate activities, processes, best practices and work products to support such changes efficiently. The implementation method addresses in more details the following goals: Separate the business process artefacts as a manageable artifact using discovery, analysis and implementation activities Link processes to business context, challenges and goals Develop the process model using Business Process Modeling Notation: for both process documentation and executable process Develop service orchestration flow Prepare the data model in scope of the business processing: the business objects with clear understanding of the life cycle, the information model, the notification framework, etc... Prepare the business process implementation and deployment using business services, process applications, service integration. Define the business process governance, maintenance and devops The method tends to be pragmatic and focuses on agile values. We are not here to develop 300 pages of document over a period of 6 months, we prefer to develop with business users and demonstrate to all project stakeholders the executable processes, with business decisions or not. The process is the documentation, the ruleset is the documentation of the decision logic behind some of the process task. As an iterative and incremental methodology, the work products and deliverables of the business automation implementation are developed by timeboxed iterations . Some iteration concludes by a process Playback . The recommended iteration length is two to three weeks, to keep the momentum, manage the scope and control the quality. Workstreams organize the work by main project disciplines and skill set. Each workstream includes tasks to plan and execute and work products to build and deliver as part of the solution. The playbacks could include user interface and integration. A common approach is to focus the first playbacks on human centric process flow and user interface, use mock up service for integration so the process can be easily demonstrated end to end. But developers should focus on integration as early as possible, to avoid castrophic issues later in the project. Integration is the risky and consume time, the methodology does not ignore them but enforce considering them earlier. Accept swivel chair approach if it makes sense to postpone complex integration (user re key some data on an external system). The figure below illustrates the parallel workstream of activities organized around skill set, product usage and disciplines: Process, Decision, Architecture, service, testing, platform,... Example of releases and playbacks are also mentionned. The approach is to build by increment, validate business hypothesis and needs for a given release. Playback \u00b6 A playback is a focused demonstration of a partially implemented process application, delivered to the business and IT communities for discussion, consensus-building and approval. Project stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback that drive the next iterations of development. Get executive consensus and approval around the partially implemented process model.

A process may execute through many boundaries and controls of existing corporate organizations and departments. Using process automation product to support the design, execution, and monitoring of a business process involves starting on the good track with a strong methodology. One of the key values of the business process automation is to enable organizations to cope with the pace of change. For this fundamental reason, the methodology to support the process development has to be tailored to such rapid life cycle and to include the appropriate activities, processes, best practices and work products to support such changes efficiently. The implementation method addresses in more details the following goals: Separate the business process artefacts as a manageable artifact using discovery, analysis and implementation activities Link processes to business context, challenges and goals Develop the process model using Business Process Modeling Notation: for both process documentation and executable process Develop service orchestration flow Prepare the data model in scope of the business processing: the business objects with clear understanding of the life cycle, the information model, the notification framework, etc... Prepare the business process implementation and deployment using business services, process applications, service integration. Define the business process governance, maintenance and devops The method tends to be pragmatic and focuses on agile values. We are not here to develop 300 pages of document over a period of 6 months, we prefer to develop with business users and demonstrate to all project stakeholders the executable processes, with business decisions or not. The process is the documentation, the ruleset is the documentation of the decision logic behind some of the process task. As an iterative and incremental methodology, the work products and deliverables of the business automation implementation are developed by timeboxed iterations . Some iteration concludes by a process Playback . The recommended iteration length is two to three weeks, to keep the momentum, manage the scope and control the quality. Workstreams organize the work by main project disciplines and skill set. Each workstream includes tasks to plan and execute and work products to build and deliver as part of the solution. The playbacks could include user interface and integration. A common approach is to focus the first playbacks on human centric process flow and user interface, use mock up service for integration so the process can be easily demonstrated end to end. But developers should focus on integration as early as possible, to avoid castrophic issues later in the project. Integration is the risky and consume time, the methodology does not ignore them but enforce considering them earlier. Accept swivel chair approach if it makes sense to postpone complex integration (user re key some data on an external system). The figure below illustrates the parallel workstream of activities organized around skill set, product usage and disciplines: Process, Decision, Architecture, service, testing, platform,... Example of releases and playbacks are also mentionned. The approach is to build by increment, validate business hypothesis and needs for a given release.","title":"Business automation application development"},{"location":"methodology/overview/#playback","text":"A playback is a focused demonstration of a partially implemented process application, delivered to the business and IT communities for discussion, consensus-building and approval.

With growing volumes of invoices, business rule automation helps reduce the amount of human intervention for account processing, detect issues earlier, and incorporate changes quickly when needed. Go to top | Go to Getting Start Lab Full Demo Narration \u00b6 Expand to view Demo Narration and Flow Demo Start Page Reviewing the demo launch page we see a text summary describing the demo and a discovery map diagram for our reference. We will only focus on the Validate Invoice Data step in the flow. OK, let's launch the demo. Customer invoice submissions We start by becoming the customer. From the Focus Corp Accounts Payable Invoices portal, we select an invoice ending with R (therefore it should be rejected) and submit for rule validation. We review five key data fields extracted from the invoice using intelligent document processing and then submit for validation. This invoice is rejected by the business rules as the total amount must be greater than 0. Let's resubmit that invoice by fixing the total amount to $100 and see what the rules say. We can also take a look at the fields that the business rules use to make their decision. And this time, the corrected invoice is accepted and passes rule validation. We have various other invoices to try, let's select another one ending in R that should be rejected, but this time the rules do not find an issue and it is accepted. This type of result means more rework in downstream business processes as humans are involved in more review and the invoice is routed back and forth to be fixed. Operations week 1 Further, we can see from the Operations Specialist's Accounts Payable dashboard that the average invoice processing time in the upper right is unmanageable at above 100 minutes. Further, the rules deviated from the final result on more than 60 invoices this week, adding to rework. Rules must change at the speed of the changing business so let's see how we can improve the business rules. Rules manager As a rules manager, we have access to the invoice validation decision model. The invoice data move from the oval at the bottom through multiple sub-decisions including a text rule to check the total amount is more than $0 which resulted in our first invoice being rejected. Another decision table looks for combinations of PO numbers and supplier types that do not follow the correct pattern (update!). This is where the second invoice should have be rejected but the table is missing a new invalid pattern. The rules manager, a business user, edits the decision model, adds a new row, easily does a copy/paste of the existing row to get a head start, exactly like a spreadsheet, adjusts the values to match the new Inc. based rejection pattern and the rule is ready. Tables automatically generate multiple text rules that follow the same pattern so we do not have to write them all from scratch. Let's validate our work in real time by running the same test case as before that should have been rejected. Great, and with the new rule we get the rejection reason we just created. Once they save the new decision model for audit and compliance, the rule manager can run an automated regression test but instead we'll move on to simulation. Loading an old simulation report before the rule change, we see rule metrics including the number of invoices approved and rejected as well as trends by date and invoice amount. No high invoice amounts are being rejected, interesting. The business knows most of the high value invoices are Inc. vendors so the new rule should catch more of these errors. After running a new simulation and comparing side by side, the business can make an informed decision about the impact of new rules before ever deploying to production. Yes, this looks as expected so we are ready to deploy. In this case, the business can deploy on their own but this can be configured for only certain safe rules and others must go through IT testing. Customer approved to rejected After the rules manager deploys the new rules, we go back to the invoice submission and choose the same invoice that should now be rejected. We see the invalid pattern of PO number and supplier type and we select in the demo control panel to upgrade to the latest rule version. The results, rejected with the reason code deployed by the business rule manager. Operations week 2 After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist reviews their updated dashboard and sees solid improvement with a reduction of average invoice processing time from less invoice rework and also less deviation between the rules and the final invoice decision. Our rules are more accurate. Use Case Summary We just used decision automation, a capability within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, to automate an accounts payable process.

Another decision table looks for combinations of PO numbers and supplier types that do not follow the correct pattern (update!). This is where the second invoice should have be rejected but the table is missing a new invalid pattern. The rules manager, a business user, edits the decision model, adds a new row, easily does a copy/paste of the existing row to get a head start, exactly like a spreadsheet, adjusts the values to match the new Inc. based rejection pattern and the rule is ready. Tables automatically generate multiple text rules that follow the same pattern so we do not have to write them all from scratch. Let's validate our work in real time by running the same test case as before that should have been rejected. Great, and with the new rule we get the rejection reason we just created. Once they save the new decision model for audit and compliance, the rule manager can run an automated regression test but instead we'll move on to simulation. Loading an old simulation report before the rule change, we see rule metrics including the number of invoices approved and rejected as well as trends by date and invoice amount. No high invoice amounts are being rejected, interesting. The business knows most of the high value invoices are Inc. vendors so the new rule should catch more of these errors. After running a new simulation and comparing side by side, the business can make an informed decision about the impact of new rules before ever deploying to production. Yes, this looks as expected so we are ready to deploy. In this case, the business can deploy on their own but this can be configured for only certain safe rules and others must go through IT testing. Customer approved to rejected After the rules manager deploys the new rules, we go back to the invoice submission and choose the same invoice that should now be rejected. We see the invalid pattern of PO number and supplier type and we select in the demo control panel to upgrade to the latest rule version. The results, rejected with the reason code deployed by the business rule manager. Operations week 2 After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist reviews their updated dashboard and sees solid improvement with a reduction of average invoice processing time from less invoice rework and also less deviation between the rules and the final invoice decision. Our rules are more accurate. Use Case Summary We just used decision automation, a capability within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, to automate an accounts payable process. With growing volumes of invoices, business rule automation helps reduce the amount of human intervention for account processing, detect issues earlier, and incorporate changes quickly when needed.

Go to top | Go to Getting Start Lab Full Demo Narration \u00b6 Expand to view Demo Narration and Flow Demo Start Page Reviewing the demo launch page we see a text summary describing the demo and a discovery map diagram for our reference. We will only focus on the Validate Invoice Data step in the flow. OK, let's launch the demo. Customer invoice submissions We start by becoming the customer. From the Focus Corp Accounts Payable Invoices portal, we select an invoice ending with R (therefore it should be rejected) and submit for rule validation. We review five key data fields extracted from the invoice using intelligent document processing and then submit for validation. This invoice is rejected by the business rules as the total amount must be greater than 0. Let's resubmit that invoice by fixing the total amount to $100 and see what the rules say. We can also take a look at the fields that the business rules use to make their decision. And this time, the corrected invoice is accepted and passes rule validation. We have various other invoices to try, let's select another one ending in R that should be rejected, but this time the rules do not find an issue and it is accepted. This type of result means more rework in downstream business processes as humans are involved in more review and the invoice is routed back and forth to be fixed. Operations week 1 Further, we can see from the Operations Specialist's Accounts Payable dashboard that the average invoice processing time in the upper right is unmanageable at above 100 minutes. Further, the rules deviated from the final result on more than 60 invoices this week, adding to rework. Rules must change at the speed of the changing business so let's see how we can improve the business rules. Rules manager As a rules manager, we have access to the invoice validation decision model.

Another decision table looks for combinations of PO numbers and supplier types that do not follow the correct pattern (update!). This is where the second invoice should have be rejected but the table is missing a new invalid pattern. The rules manager, a business user, edits the decision model, adds a new row, easily does a copy/paste of the existing row to get a head start, exactly like a spreadsheet, adjusts the values to match the new Inc. based rejection pattern and the rule is ready. Tables automatically generate multiple text rules that follow the same pattern so we do not have to write them all from scratch. Let's validate our work in real time by running the same test case as before that should have been rejected. Great, and with the new rule we get the rejection reason we just created.

We see the invalid pattern of PO number and supplier type and we select in the demo control panel to upgrade to the latest rule version. The results, rejected with the reason code deployed by the business rule manager. Operations week 2 After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist reviews their updated dashboard and sees solid improvement with a reduction of average invoice processing time from less invoice rework and also less deviation between the rules and the final invoice decision.

The invoice data move from the oval at the bottom through multiple sub-decisions including a text rule to check the total amount is more than $0 which resulted in our first invoice being rejected. Another decision table looks for combinations of PO numbers and supplier types that do not follow the correct pattern (update!). This is where the second invoice should have be rejected but the table is missing a new invalid pattern. The rules manager, a business user, edits the decision model, adds a new row, easily does a copy/paste of the existing row to get a head start, exactly like a spreadsheet, adjusts the values to match the new Inc. based rejection pattern and the rule is ready. Tables automatically generate multiple text rules that follow the same pattern so we do not have to write them all from scratch. Let's validate our work in real time by running the same test case as before that should have been rejected. Great, and with the new rule we get the rejection reason we just created. Once they save the new decision model for audit and compliance, the rule manager can run an automated regression test but instead we'll move on to simulation. Loading an old simulation report before the rule change, we see rule metrics including the number of invoices approved and rejected as well as trends by date and invoice amount. No high invoice amounts are being rejected, interesting. The business knows most of the high value invoices are Inc. vendors so the new rule should catch more of these errors. After running a new simulation and comparing side by side, the business can make an informed decision about the impact of new rules before ever deploying to production. Yes, this looks as expected so we are ready to deploy. In this case, the business can deploy on their own but this can be configured for only certain safe rules and others must go through IT testing. Customer approved to rejected After the rules manager deploys the new rules, we go back to the invoice submission and choose the same invoice that should now be rejected. We see the invalid pattern of PO number and supplier type and we select in the demo control panel to upgrade to the latest rule version. The results, rejected with the reason code deployed by the business rule manager. Operations week 2 After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist reviews their updated dashboard and sees solid improvement with a reduction of average invoice processing time from less invoice rework and also less deviation between the rules and the final invoice decision. Our rules are more accurate. Use Case Summary We just used decision automation, a capability within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, to automate an accounts payable process. With growing volumes of invoices, business rule automation helps reduce the amount of human intervention for account processing, detect issues earlier, and incorporate changes quickly when needed.

Add automation services to your application \u00b6 Expand to view Now that you have an application, you can add the automation services you published so you can use them in the low-code build environment. On the right, locate the All views drop down under Drag a component to your page header, click and select Automation service at the bottom. Click the Add + button Click to select the name of the automation service you published earlier and then select all the operations and click Next . Now that you the automation service is in the palette on the right, click and drag it into the application as pictured below (or you can choose another location if you prefer). First, select the operation at the top as HR_Send_Offer_Letter . Now, we need to map data stored in the application (provided by the template) to the automation service so it will be sent to the HR Send Offer Letter process. Make the following changes for the first variable row in the Inputs section: under Variable options , click the drop down and select Use existing variable under Variable names , click Select and expand selectedCandidateDetails and select fullname . under Create field , uncheck the box as we do not need to see the candidates name since it is already in the upper left corner. Repeat the same three steps above, selecting selectedCandidateDetails -> personalEmail for the second step. Click Done . A new button is added to the application that will launch the process and send the two variables automatically! Feel free to click the button and edit it using the palette that appears directly below. I would recommend using the pencil to change the name and you can also use the paint bucket to change the color. Next, we will add the second automation service to the application, a decision service to calculate a suggested salary based on information from the candidate and position. Use the right palette to click and drag the same automation service on to the application, this time below the blue header (or in a location you prefer). Select the operation at the top as Calculate_Candidate_Salary_Range . Map the data stored in the application to the automation service as before so the business rules can use it to make the decision. Make the following changes for the first variable row in the Inputs section: under Variable options , click the drop down and select Use existing variable under Variable names , click Select and expand selectedCandidateDetails -> jobDetails -> jobStatus . under Create field , uncheck the box. Repeat the same three steps above for the remaining three variables using the following values for the second step: selectedCandidateDetails -> country selectedCandidateDetails -> jobDetails -> jobLevel selectedCandidateDetails -> employmentType For the output variable at the bottom, you may retain the defaults to Create a new variable and Create field on page . Click Done . The result is that three elements are added to the page: a button to launch the service and two decimal/numeric fields for the output of minimum and maximum. If you wish, you can perform some layout to move them around. For example, right click on the button just added and create a horizontal layout or panel before it, then drag the three elements into it. You may also try clicking on one of the numeric fields such as Minimum and clicking the gear to configure it, try to locate Format and set it to Currency to automatically show a currency symbol for your country. Congratulations, you added a workflow and decision service to your application, all without writing any code! Go to top | Go to Getting Start Lab 9. Preview the completed application \u00b6 Expand to view Let's preview the application again and try out the automation services you added. In the upper right, click Preview . NOTE: as before, it may take some time for the template to be deployed and the application will launch in a new browser window/tab which may be blocked by your browser.

Summary \u00b6 Expand to view In just a few minutes, you created, tested and published a new, low-code business application from a template and connected it to existing workflow and decision automation services. This low-code experience enables greater control and simplicity in application authoring while accelerating time to value for the business teams that use the applications. Go to top | Go to Getting Start Lab Full Demo Narration \u00b6 Expand to view Intro \u00b6 HR teams manage adhoc processes outside their systems of record, gathering data, performing reviews, sending offers, looping around to do rework unfortunately before finally obtaining the goal to onboard an employee. Additionally, HR Specialists use multiple, disparate systems to complete their work and can easily lose track of the process. It's time for an easy to use low-code build environment where HR can create dynamic, unified business applications that connect to existing systems and deliver value quickly. Demo Start Page \u00b6 Reviewing the demo launch page we see a text summary describing the demo along with a discovery map and diagram for our reference. OK, let's launch the demo. Studio Intro \u00b6 Welcome to the Studio low-code build environment. As an Application Assembler you can use Studio to create Applications and connect to Business Automations. Automation service creation \u00b6 Before we build our application, let's find and connect to some existing workflow and decision services that we want to use. Studio can connect to external business automation services you already have today and unify them in a single application user experience with the low-code Application Designer. After we connect to Business Automation Workflow HR environment, Studio prompts us to select our the application and operations to automatically import. We'll select send offer letter and calculate salary range. The Studio imports and automatically publishes a service and we can confirm the operations and relevant inputs and outputs. Now we are ready to create our application! Preview onboarding application template \u00b6 Studio includes multiple templates to start from, let's preview and try out the Onboarding Application template. The app pulls in our sample requisition and candidate data and provides an easy to use search and filter on the left. After selecting a candidate, we see their details and status; let's mark Alicia as Prepare to onboard, and then change some document status values. Create application from template \u00b6 This template looks good, let's use it to create our own application. Add automation service \u00b6 We start in the low-code Application Designer and it's time to import our automation services from before so we can add them to the app. It's as simple as drag and drop. Let's add a button for send offer letter at the upper right, we select the operation, map the data since it already exists in our app from the template, and my button is automatically added. Don't like grey buttons? Change it to yellow, rename it, add an icon and make it a little smaller. All with no code, we just integrated to an existing external workflow from inside our app! We also need to add that calculation service that uses business rules to decide a recommended salary range. Let's drag it just below the right header and map the data in very much the same way as the other service. This service returns an output so we let Application Designer create a new variable to hold it and add it to the page automatically, so simple. With multiple elements on the screen, let's do some simple layout by adding a panel and dragging the fields into it. We can also do advanced formatting such as setting the field to currency for the symbols and decimal places or moving to advanced mode to set a read only status and much more. After doing the same to the second field, and formatting the button, we are ready to preview our app! Preview and use automation services \u00b6 Now in the running app, after selecting one of the candidates we immediately see our edits live. First, let's calculate the salary range and see the values that the decision service brings back based on the candidate data. Now, before we launch the send offer letter process, let's bring up the current work list. On the right we see one task from an older process. Now when we click to send a new offer letter, another task appears on the right for the assignee to complete. For testing, we can even open the task and see the application passed along the required data. Looks good to me. Run in Navigator \u00b6 After deploying to the production runtime, called Navigator, we can see the app appear on our home screen, run it and use it as before during the preview but now in a unified Navigator environment with multiple applications and tabs all in one experience and interface! Use Case Summary \u00b6 We just used the low-code Studio environment and its Application Designer to create a dynamic business application from a pre-built template to accelerate time to value. Then we connected to external automation services including existing workflows and decision services, to help automate the onboarding process. It's time to remove frustration and slow business results and replace them with productive and happy employees and customers.

Scenario Introduction - Onboarding Automation \u00b6 Expand to view Use Case Overview Employee applicant (John Doe) submitted an employee application and video interview along with other materials as part of the employment application process. During this process, HR processors initially reviewed the employment application making comments and annotations on the document along with entering video bookmarks, allowing additional reviewers to quickly locate key responses. Lucy along with other reviewers are able to review all the information and documents pertaining to applicant John Doe in the teamspace in a consistent and secure manner using an intuitive user-interface. Some of the information such as the applicant's SSN, is available on some of the documents but they are redacted so that only reviewers with the appropriate permission are able to see the redacted content. The use of video bookmarks also allows Lucy to quickly jump to key sections of the video without necessarily having to watch the entire video. Finally, Lucy is able to integrate with enterprise workflow to launch additional manual and automated processes. Discovery Map Go to top | Go to Getting Started Lab 2.

Go to top | Go to Getting Started Lab 4. Create and Review Teamspace \u00b6 Expand to view Let\u2019s now look at teamspaces. Teamspaces represent a focused view of the relevant folders, documents and searches that a team needs to complete their tasks. Our use case revolves around Lucy reviewing an existing teamspace for employee applicant John Doe. Typicaly, the teamspace would already be created, processed and reviewed by a few HR processors before reaching Lucy to further review and approve the applicant for onboarding. In this section, you first create an employee onboarding teamspace for the employee applicant John Doe. Next, you will review how a teamspace is used once it is created. 4.1 - Create Teamspace An Employee Onboarding teamspace template should already be available. If not or if you want to learn more about creating teamspace templates, please proceed to the section below - 4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder . Otherwise, proceed to section 4.1.2 - Teamspace Builder . 4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder \u2139\ufe0f This section is recommended but optional. If you do not want to perform this section and use the existing teamspace template, please proceed to section 4.1.2 Teamspace Builder . This section covers the creation of a teamspace template using the teamspace template builder. The use of teamspace templates allows for the configuration of the folder hierarchy, documents, search templates, and security in a user-friendly wizard interface which can then be used to create teamspaces in a timely, secure and consistent manner. 1. From the navigation menu, click on Teamspaces 2. Click on the Templates tab and then click on New Template As shown in the diagram below, the Teamspace Template Builder is displayed. The teamspace template builder uses a wizard-driven user interface that guides you through the following steps: - Define Teamspace Template - Select Searches - Select Classes or Entry Templates - Folders and Documents Tree - Select Roles 3. Teamspace Template Builder - Define Teamspace Template Enter a value for the Template name and Template description . If you are using a shared environment and plan to share the template, please select a value that distinguishes your template from others. In the diagram below, a generic template name and description is used for the employee onboarding use case and specified not to share the template. At this point, you can continue to the next step by clicking on the Next button for the remaining configuration items (searches, classes/entry templates, folders/documents and roles). At any point, you can complete the configuration of the template by clicking on the Finish button and optionally edit the configuration at a later time. When complete, click on the Next button to continue to the next step. 4. Teamspace Template Builder - Select Searches You will not specify any searches for the teamspace, click the Next button to continue to the next step 5.

Finally, click on the Next button to continue to the next step. \u2139\ufe0f If the Employment Application class is not available, please contact your Administrator to make it available to you. Otherwise, selecting the default Document class is sufficient - you will just not see the custom properties (First Name, Last Name, Application Date) when adding the application document to the teamspace. 6. Teamspace Template Builder - Folders and Documents Tree This step configures the folder structure that will be used for the teamspace. Additionally, documents can be added to the folder(s). The use of a common folder structure and default documents provides a consistent process so that any teamspaces created with this template uses a consistent and standardized folder hierarchy and documents. Click New Folder and then build the folder structure shown below or create your own custom folder structure. To add a document to a folder, click on the Add Document button and add a document. When complete, click on the Next button to continue to the last step. 7.

Upon selecting a final, third order, the rules this time are not certain and send the refund request off to a human queue for manual investigation. This bottom investigation branch of the straight through process can utilize significant resources. Operations week 1 A few manual refunds are not a problem for the team, but too many will cause delays and our customer satisfaction will go down. The Operations Specialist reviews the Refund Dashboard, powered by Business Automation Insights and see not only the percentage of manually processed requests is high at more than 67% but the average manual investigation time across all requests is more than 2 hours. They pass their findings to the Rule Manager to take action. Rules manager As a rules manager, we have access to the decision model behind our refund process. The data is passed from the process system to the rules in the form of an order and refund request. This moves through various decision tables including a time window validation that deals with the return reason, the days since delivery and the condition of the goods. In combination, these lead to various processing decisions and we see a few that result in manual processing listed. Another decision table deals with the type of goods and may also result in some manual processing. Finally, this is then combined with a simple text rule to make the final decision. The rules manager drafted up a new branch of the decision model with some updates, let's take a look. To reduce manual processing, the rules manager adjusted the tables to remove some of the manual processing decisions. Comparing the two versions shows that row 3 column 3 moved from manual to denied, for example. Other rows were removed which results in an default approved decision. We could also test and simulate the rule changes and compare historical results but we won't cover that here in this demo. Customer manual to approved After the Rules Manager deploys the new rules, let go back to being a customer and try them out. Submitting the same order as before which resulted in a manual result now is approved! Operations week After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist sees some solid improvement with a reduction in half for manual requests and also lower manual processing time average from above 120, down to only 60 mins. Use Case Summary With combined workflow and decision automation, both capabilities within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, and updated business rules, we reduce the manual processing queues significantly Increased straight through processing results in lower average completion time, lower costs, and more consistent communication with the customer throughout the process. Now our processors can truly increase customer satisfaction.

Demo Start Page After reviewing the demo launch page including the outline and discovery map, we are ready to launch the Line of Business Supervisor's Workplace interface, the single place you manage all your work. Manage workstream teams You check out the start workflow list and see great starting activities and workflows such as approval, checklist and more. You start by managing the teams. It's a good idea to add yourself to at least Administrators and Supervisors and maybe Team managers. You can also create a Shared Services team so you can assign work to them later. Create a workstream Now it's time to create a workstream for incoming shared services requests. We'll set it so everyone can start and give a description. The simple, no-code editor allows you to assemble a workflow in just a few clicks. Start with a checklist activity to represent the skill profile requested. To make this reusable, we add checklist items with placeholders and allow the user that launches the flow to update and add more. Let's also add a couple data items for the country and date available. Once the request is submitted, the shared services team member will complete this form and confirm their skills. Your first activity is complete! We add another step to get manager approval and setup a simple branch flow. For the approval branch we add a form to notify of the result. Then, head back to our approval and add the rejection branch. So simple! To complete the workstream, we save and we're ready to go. Test a workstream The new flow starts in trial mode for the author or a testing group to try it out safely before the end users. Simple to test, we see the launch screen specific to this workstream where the user starting the flow, such as an Accounts Payable clerk, will configure available options including checklist items, and also any activity assignments allowed by the workstream, which we did not activate yet. Once started, we go back to the main Workplace. Let's take on the role of a shared services team member and see how easy it is to complete the first step. Claim and open the task, check the checklist items, fill in the data, optionally attach a document for review, type a comment and submit. This is much easier and more organized than email. Now taking on my team manager role for approval, all looks good and I accept. Finally, the original requestor receives an approval notification to complete the request. Back at the task list we can switch to workflows and without any customization, the tool provides a complete audit trail of all work by default. Publish a workstream Once ready, I can request a publish to share my workstream with other teams. The platform has a built-in approval workstream for workstreams! So we head to the same task list, click to review the workstream definition. As a publisher, I may send it back with comments or publish directly. And in just a few minutes, I created, tested and published a new, lightweight workflow available to anyone in my organization: ready to launch! Use Case Summary As you saw, Workstream Services helps you manage remote work more effectively by allowing business users to create lightweight workflows that automate internal processes, no coding required.

[Go to top](#introduction) | [Go to Guided Tour](#use-case-guided-tour) 8 - Summary As you saw, Workstream Services helps you manage remote work more effectively by allowing business users to create lightweight workflows that automate internal processes, no coding required. Get ready to improve your team's productivity by simplifying common tasks and decreasing the complexity and limitations of remote work. [Go to top](#introduction) | [Go to Guided Tour](#use-case-guided-tour) Full Demo Narration \u00b6 Intro \u00b6 Working in a remote environment adds complexity to most tasks. Imagine you lead a shared services team and receive requests from other departments such as Accounts Payable or HR. In person, it's simple to collect information and share status. However, in a remote environment, organizing work is more challenging. Relying on email and phone is just not enough. Work can be duplicated or executed inconsistently, resulting in lost data and delays. You need a lightweight workflow to manage incoming requests. Demo Start Page \u00b6 After reviewing the demo launch page including the outline and discovery map, we are ready to launch the Line of Business Supervisor's Workplace interface, the single place you manage all your work. Manage workstream teams \u00b6 You check out the start workflow list and see great starting activities and workflows such as approval, checklist and more. You start by managing the teams. It's a good idea to add yourself to at least Administrators and Supervisors and maybe Team managers. You can also create a Shared Services team so you can assign work to them later. Create a workstream \u00b6 Now it's time to create a workstream for incoming shared services requests. We'll set it so everyone can start and give a description. The simple, no-code editor allows you to assemble a workflow in just a few clicks. Start with a checklist activity to represent the skill profile requested. To make this reusable, we add checklist items with placeholders and allow the user that launches the flow to update and add more. Let's also add a couple data items for the country and date available. Once the request is submitted, the shared services team member will complete this form and confirm their skills. Your first activity is complete! We add another step to get manager approval and setup a simple branch flow. For the approval branch we add a form to notify of the result. Then, head back to our approval and add the rejection branch. So simple! To complete the workstream, we save and we're ready to go. Test a workstream \u00b6 The new flow starts in trial mode for the author or a testing group to try it out safely before the end users. Simple to test, we see the launch screen specific to this workstream where the user starting the flow, such as an Accounts Payable clerk, will configure available options including checklist items, and also any activity assignments allowed by the workstream, which we did not activate yet. Once started, we go back to the main Workplace. Let's take on the role of a shared services team member and see how easy it is to complete the first step. Claim and open the task, check the checklist items, fill in the data, optionally attach a document for review, type a comment and submit. This is much easier and more organized than email. Now taking on my team manager role for approval, all looks good and I accept. Finally, the original requestor receives an approval notification to complete the request. Back at the task list we can switch to workflows and without any customization, the tool provides a complete audit trail of all work by default. Publish a workstream \u00b6 Once ready, I can request a publish to share my workstream with other teams. The platform has a built-in approval workstream for workstreams! So we head to the same task list, click to review the workstream definition. As a publisher, I may send it back with comments or publish directly. And in just a few minutes, I created, tested and published a new, lightweight workflow available to anyone in my organization: ready to launch! Use Case Summary \u00b6 As you saw, Workstream Services helps you manage remote work more effectively by allowing business users to create lightweight workflows that automate internal processes, no coding required.
