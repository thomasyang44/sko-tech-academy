# Step 3 - Configure the ADP Project

1. The out-of-the-box ADP project is used as a part of this scenario. Retrieve the project ID of the default project in your system. Note that this project contains the Utility Bill class.

**Note:** We are currently working on adding additional instructions to configure a custom ADP project for the Client Onboarding scenario. In the meantime, you can either contact Clandis Baker for the custom instructions or disable the call to ADP in the end-to-end when you import the Workflow solution as a part of a later step. 

If you are using RPA as a part of the scenario, [setup the RPA server](Step%204%20-%20RPA%20Server.md).
If you are not using RPA, go directly to [importing the Workflow solution](Step%205%20-%20Workflow%20Solution.md).
