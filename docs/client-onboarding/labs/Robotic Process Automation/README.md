# IBM Robotic Process Automation

## Overview

Going from simple, back-office task automation to scaled  automation to handle time-consuming business processes can be a  challenge. The IBMÂ® Robotic Process Automation offering helps you automate more business and IT processes at scale with the ease and speed of traditional RPA. Software robots, or bots, can act on AI insights to  complete tasks with no lag time and enable you to achieve digital transformation.
