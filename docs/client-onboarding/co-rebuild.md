# Rebuild (Individual)

!!! note
    These labs assume that you have installed IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation v21.0.3 on a ROKS cluster as described [here](../deploy/overview.md) and imported the Client Onboarding[^1] scenario as described [here](co-deploy-integrate.md).  

[^1]:
    The Client Onboarding assets have been adapted from the
    <a href="https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-labs/tree/main/21.0.3" target="_blank">IBM TechJam 21.0.3</a>
    materials as developed by the IBM SWAT Team  

<br>
The labs below can be used to learn how various capabilities were configured in the Client Onboarding solution. As you already have expertise in one or more capability, **you are encouraged to select a lab for a capability that you have the LEAST experience with and/or is the most needed skill in your market.  Further, every member of the team should select a different rebuild lab for their first.**  Once the first Rebuild lab is completed, you may select additional rebuild labs or proceed to [Customization](co-customization.md).  
<br>
As you perform the lab, think and coordinate with your team members how you might be able to customize the capability to fit client PoC requirements.  
<br>
This lab is considered an individual activity as each team member should work on a separate rebuild lab.  However, all work should be done on the shared team cluster and **collaboration is highly recommended** as you build components into your customized Client Onboarding PoC demonstration (Day 4).  

!!! warning
    Please note that you may need to redeploy your application depending on the rebuild lab update.

!!! warning
    Content including the labs are based on the IBM SWAT Client Onboarding[^1] materials which are configured for the **Production** pattern.  Our environment uses the **Starter** pattern and based on that, you may encounter some differences at certain steps.  
    <br>
    Below are some differences you should be aware of, please post to the slack channel if you encounter additional differences.  
    - BAWTOS => TARGET  
    - CLOS => CONTENT  
    - cp4bausers => cp4admin

??? note summary "Expand to view"

    ### **Overview**  

    IBM Business Automation Insights (BAI) is a cloud capability to capture end to end business data (events) from Cloud Pak for Automation (CP4A) platform components to operational data store and long-term store (data lake).
    BAI provides real-time operational visibility to Business Managers via custom or pre-built set of dashboards. Custom dashboards can be built by IT (using Kibana) or business users (using Business Performance Center).
    The data collected by BAI and stored in the data lake can be used to inject AI into CP4A platform, for example it can be used to make recommendations to business managers and knowledge workers.
    Business Performance Center is a no-code monitoring application native to IBM Business Automation Insights. You can design and share dashboards in minutes that capture business data in near real time and provide real time awareness of important business activities and processes.

    !!! warning
        <span style="color:Red">ℹ️ **[SKO UPDATE]**</span> Use the symbolic names for **Case Reference ID (Case_Reference_ID)** and **Client Name (Client_Name)** properties.  Replace these with where you see **usrxxxReferenceID** and **usrxxxClientName** in the lab document.  
        
        <span style="color:Red">ℹ️ **[SKO UPDATE]**</span> We will NOT use the **CLOS** object store and instead use the existing **CONTENT** object store. Expand the section below to add the folder subclasses.  

        ??? note summary "Expand to view"
            1. Log into the FileNet **Administrative Console for Content Engine** (ACCE) as **cp4admin** and select the object store named **CONTENT**.  
               Note: the entry in the access-info file will be named: **Content Platform Engine administration**  

            2. Navigate to Data Design -> Property Templates. Create the two property templates:

                | Name                  | Symbolic Name      |  Type     |
                | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :-------- |

            3. Navigate to Data Design -> Classes. Create a new subclass of the **Folder** class with the name **SWAT Jam Case Folder** (Symbolic ID SWAT_JAM_Case_Folder).  

            4. Open the Folder class and add the two new property templates from above. Make sure you **Save** the modified folder subclass.  

            5. Create the indicated folder structure under the Root folder. The **Case Folders** folder is a regular folder using the **Folder** object class.  
            <br> The **Sample Test Folder TEST1** should be created using the **SWAT Jam Case Folder** class and have the **Case Reference ID** and **Client Name** properties set to **TEST1**.  
            <br> The **Sample Test Folder TEST2** should be created using the **SWAT Jam Case Folder** class and have the **Case Reference ID** and **Client Name** properties set to **TEST2**.

    In this lab, you will create a small hierarchy of Document classes to
    capture different kinds of documents together with custom metadata,
    and will learn about the most important security concepts. You will
    explore Document storage and learn to migrate documents between
    different Storage Areas.  Further you will determine how to trigger
    custom actions for example when new documents have arrived, and how to
    configure and test functionality of content based retrieval,
    i.e. searches for documents based on information contained in the
    documents themselves, not (only) on their metadata.
    <br><br>
    On this lab, for triggering the custom actions, a custom javascript is used to file a newly uploaded document into a folder, those identity is derived from a search. The script is available in the

    The second lab on GraphQL builds on top of the first one, as the searches performed using GraphQL use the documents and document classes defined in the first lab. Here you learn by a series of example, how to build the most important queries using GraphQL. The examples also show how to download documents using GraphQL, how to create folders, and modify security settings.
