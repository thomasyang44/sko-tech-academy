# Deploy and Integrate (Team)

!!! note
    These instructions assume that you have Cloud Pak for Business Automation 21.0.3 installed along with **Open Prediction Service (OPS)**.  
    <br>
    The CP4BA cluster that has been provisioned for you for Tech Academy meets these requirements.

!!! warning
    You must use the artifacts downloaded from this site.  
    <br>
    Do **NOT** use the original SWAT artifacts you may have downloaded previously as these are from a Production deployment of CP4BA and there are subtle differences.

## Instructions

There are 7 sections that you will need to import and build the **Client Onboarding**[^1] solution into your team cluster.  

[^1]:
    The Client Onboarding assets have been adapted from the
    <a href="https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-labs/tree/main/21.0.3" target="_blank">IBM TechJam 21.0.3</a>
    materials as developed by the IBM SWAT Team


Below are the recommended tracks so that different members of the team can be the primary driver of the lab. Please designate the primary driver using a team member that may not be the most experienced in each capability. As a recommendation, use the Slack huddle feature so members of the team can clearly see the steps that are being performed.  

| Track   | Section(s) | Description                                                                                      |

## 1. Import the ADS ML Model
<a name="deploy-integrate-1"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"

    1\. Open the ADS ML Service (Open Prediction Service) in your browser.  
    <br>
    To find the link for this component, open the OpenShift web console and select **Networking** then **Routes**. These are all the public links exposed by the OpenShift cluster. To easily find the **ADS ML Service** public link, select **ads-ml-service** from the project dropdown near the top of the screen as shown in the diagram below.  
    <br>
    From the **Location** column, click on the link to open the **Swagger UI** for the **ADS ML Service**.  
    <br>
    ![ADS ML Route](./images/ads-route.png)
    
    2\. Under `manage`, expand the `POST /models Add Model` section  
    ![adl-ml-services-all-model](./images/sko-ads-ml-service-add-model.png)

    3\. Click on `Try it out`

    4\. Use the contents of the [addModel.json](Solution%20Exports/Automation%20Decision%20Services/ML/addModel.json) file as the request body. It's easier if you right click on the link and open it in a new tab.

    5\. Click on `Execute` and scroll down to the actual server repsonse (scroll past the example)

    6\. Copy the ID of the created model from the response body. It is typically `1` as this ADS ML Service is currently empty.  
    ![image-2021ID](images/sko-ads-ml-model-id.png){width="600"}  

    7\. We've added the meta-data of the model, now we must add the model binary. Under `manage`, expand the `POST /models/{model_id} Add Binary` section  
    ![image-20210601221731687](images/sko-ads-ml-service-add-model-binary.png)

    8\. Click on `Try it out`

    9\. Use the ID copied from the last API call, typically `1`.

    10\. In the request body, keep `pickle` selected as the `format`

    11\. Download this [pickle file](Solution%20Exports/Automation%20Decision%20Services/ML/service-payment-default-risk-v0-archive.pkl) onto your computer and use it as as the selected file  
    ![image-2021Binary](images/sko-ads-ml-add-binary.png){width="600"}  

    12\. Click on `Execute`. The response code is 201. The model named `service-payment-default-risk` is succesfully deployed.
    The following instructions validate that this deployment can be safely executed.

    13\. Under `run`, expand the `/predictions` section

    14\. Click on `Try it out`

    15\. Use the contents of the [runModel.json](Solution%20Exports/Automation%20Decision%20Services/ML/runModel.json) file as the request body  
    <br>
    Note: from your browser, please ensure to select **Raw Data** to view/copy the request body:  
    ![image-2021Binary](images/sko-ads-ml-run-model-raw.png){width="300"}  

    16\. Update the `$PREDICTION-ID$` in the json to the `ID` copied before, typically this is `1`.

    17\. Click on `Execute`. The result should be as follows:

        `{ "result": {  "predictions": 0,  "scores": [   0.9068544064724676,   0.0931455935275324  ]}}`

    10. In Process Designer, click on the **Environment Variables** tab.

    11. Fill out credentials for a gmail account in the **emailID** and **emailPassword** fields under the **Default** column. Note that the password here must be an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) and not your gmail password.
    This gmail account is used by the solution to send outbound emails. If you don't have a gmail account configured
    with an app password you should create one now or use the default one provided.  
    ![wf-env-variables](images/sko-wf-env-variables.png)

    12. If you are showcasing ADP as a part of the scenario, enter the ADP host, username, password, and projectID in their respective fields. If you are not, set **adpEnabled** to false.

        !!! note
            ℹ️ &nbsp; For 2022 SKO Tech Academy, we will not be showcasing ADP in this scenario  

    13. For the **documentUploadPage** environment variable, use the URL for Business Automation Navigator for CP4BA and add "?desktop=CODocumentUpload". You will add this desktop to the navigator in a later step.
    The default value is from another environment and illustrates a typical value but you must build yours using your navigator URL.

    14. The RPA bot is currently only executed if the user running the scenario matches the **rpaBotExecutionUser**. You can change this by updating the value of the **rpaBotExecutionUser** environment variable.
    In this environment the rpaBotExecution user will be called cp4admin, so only set this value to cp4admin once your option RPA server and configuration is complete otherwise the workflow will encounter errors.
    It is recommeded that you DO NOT set this value to be cp4admin until you have validated that the end to end COB scenario works without RPA first.

    15. If you are executing the RPA bot, update the value for the **rpaServer** environment variable from the environment you reserved using the previous step.

    16. The default target object store name is **TARGET**. If you have changed this, update the value for the **tosName** environment variable. Demo environments have the default target object store name of **TARGET**.

    17. In the top-right corner, click on the **Finish Editing** button.

             ⚠️ &nbsp; These steps are not required for SKO Tech Academy.  If you are using an environment that will be shared by multiple **teams**, it is important to disable certain permissions so that the objects defined for the Client Onboarding scenario are immutable.
        
        1. For the `Client Document` document class, update the security settings: remove the shared group (eg: cp4bausers) from the **Default Instance Security**. Update the **Security** and lower the access level for the cp4bausers group to `Modify properties`.

            1. On the Navigation area on the left side, open `Data Design`, `Classes`, `Document` and click on the `Client Document` class to bring up its properties on the right side.  
            ![ContentSecurityID1](images/sko-content-security-id1.png)

        **NOTE: **The target object store name specified in the Application is **TARGET**. If you are using a production environment, the target store name could be different (eg: **BAWTOS**). In that case, the 2nd page of the application won't show any documents as it looks for the documents in the TARGET object store. To fix this, you can import the application template in Studio from the main SWAT COB Repo and rebuild the app.

    9. Click on the 3-dot menu for the **Client Onboarding** application and select **Details**,

    10. Click on the **Permissions** tab.

## 7. Import the Business Automation Insights data

??? note summary "Expand to view"

    !!! warning
        There is a defect in CP4BA 21.0.3 IF008 affecting Case/BAI, events from Case are not emitted. If you are building dashboards make sure these work with preloaded data and don't depend on something you've added to the Case solution. Process events are unaffected.

    ### 7.1 Prepare Data and Import Dashboard
    <a name="deploy-integrate-72"></a>
    ??? note summary "Expand to view"
        !!! note
        If you need more guidance to update the BAI data please look in the troubleshooting guide (Section 84)
        , you will find a more prescriptive set of instructions to achieve the steps 1,2 and 3, below. It is 
        adviseable to read the outline instructions below to understand the goal of this exercise, but then use the 
        steps in the troublshooting guide if you are not confident.
        <br>

        1. Download the contents of the following directory - [Business Automation Insights](https://github.com/thomasyang44/sko-tech-academy/tree/main/docs/client-onboarding/Solution%20Exports/Business%20Automation%20Insights/){target="_blank"}.

        2. Replace the index names in the downloaded files:

            In the `process-data.json` and `case-data.json` files, the index name parameter must match the index names
            of your environment. The index names are dependent on the date of the install. For example, one of the
            index names in the provided data files is `icp4ba-bai-process-summaries-completed-idx-ibm-bai-2021.11.11-000001`.
            The date element `2021.11.11` must be replaced by the date in your new clusters index name. The image
            below shows an example of the data we need to update. You can use the tool of your choice to perform a
            global find & replace to update all the dates so they reflect the index names in your cluster. The 
            VSCode editor works well, but any code editor should work. Section 84 of the troubleshooting guide 
            describes this process and uses the sed command line tool to perform the substitution.  

            ![data replacement](images/data_replace.png)

            You can get the index names for your environment using the following command (Replace `{esadmin}` with the elasticsearch admin user ID, replace `{espassword}` with the elastichsearch admin user password & replace `{eshost}` with the elasticsearch URL):

                curl -k -XGET -u {esadmin}:{espassword} '{eshost}/_aliases'

        3. Once you have updated the sample data files, from the folder where you've downloaded the files and replaced the index names, run the following script to import the data (replace `{esadmin}` with the elasticsearch admin user ID, replace `{espassword}` with the elastichsearch admin user password & replace `{eshost}` with the elasticsearch URL):

                ES_ADMIN={esadmin}
                ES_PASSWORD={espassword}
                ES_HOST={eshost}

                curl -k -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_bulk --data-binary @case-data.json
                curl -k -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_bulk --data-binary @process-data.json
                curl -k -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_bulk --data-binary @ads-data.json

        4. Open **Business Performance Center** and click **Import.**  
        
            ![BAI-1](images/sko-BAI-1.png)

        5. Click **Browse.**

        6. Select **Client Onboarding Completed.json** (downloaded earlier) and click **Import**.
