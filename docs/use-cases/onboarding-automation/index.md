# Introduction

**Use Case:** Content and document services

**Use Case Overview:** Focus Corp accelerates the use of unstructured content in an employee onboarding use case using teamspaces and secure external file sharing. You will assume the role of Lucy, an HR employee onboarding specialist at Focus Corp. Lucy’s objective is to improve Focus Corp’s process and ensure various onboarding requirements are met in a secure, structured, consistent and timely manner to onboard the new employees. Focus Corp must collaborate both internally and externally during the employee onboarding process as well as enforce structured and adhoc workflows. 

**Choose an option:**

  * **Cloud Pak for Business Automation as a Service demo environment (likely an IBMer or Business Partner):** your environment is predeployed, continue to the [Getting Started Lab](#getting-started-lab) section below.
  * **Install Yourself:** To deploy Onboarding Automation on your own environment, and technical architecture information, see the <a href="https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/dba-onboarding-automation" target="_blank">dba-onboarding-automation</a> git repository which includes the required deployment artifacts.

??? note SUMMARY "Expand to view"

    **Use Case Overview**
    Employee applicant (John Doe) submitted an employee application and video interview along with other materials as part of the employment application process. During this process, HR processors initially reviewed the employment application making comments and annotations on the document along with entering video bookmarks, allowing additional reviewers to quickly locate key responses. Lucy along with other reviewers are able to review all the information and documents pertaining to applicant John Doe in the teamspace in a consistent and secure manner using an intuitive user-interface. Some of the information such as the applicant's SSN, is available on some of the documents but they are redacted so that only reviewers with the appropriate permission are able to see the redacted content. The use of video bookmarks also allows Lucy to quickly jump to key sections of the video without necessarily having to watch the entire video. Finally, Lucy is able to integrate with enterprise workflow to launch additional manual and automated processes.

## 3. Tour IBM Navigator
<a name="lab-section-3"></a>
??? note SUMMARY "Expand to view"

    **IBM Navigator is a desktop for an organization's workers to find and organize information.**

    You are now a Human Resources (HR) Onboarding Specialist, Lucy, at Focus Corp reviewing an applicant, John Doe, for employment. As an onboarding specialist, Lucy will use the IBM Navigator user interface to review content submitted by John such as the employment application and video interview.

    Let's take a quick tour of the **IBM Navigator** user interface.

    1\. Click on the navigation menu icon in the upper left corner of the screen  

    The navigation menu icon (also commonly referred to as the hamburger icon) is used to access the navigation menu and features such as **Browse**, **Search**, **Share**, **Teamspaces**, **Work**, **Cases** and **Reports**. Additional features can also be added using plugins. This interface including the top banner, list of features and menu options are configurable through the use of desktops.

    Note: The **Reports** feature is used for Records Management and may or may not be installed on your environment. Records Management related activities such as declaring a record can be done automatically and also manually using the **Browse** feature. The **Work** and **Cases** feature show workflow tasks assigned to the user and case manager activities (respectively).

    ![13](./images/100-Navigator-Hamburger.png)

    2\. Click the **Browse** feature  

    ![44](./images/100-Navigator-BrowseFeature.png)

    You are now viewing a repository called **Corporate Operations** which is an **IBM FileNet Content Manager** repository.
    
    !!! note
        You can also access other repositories and perform cross-repository searches using **CM8** (IBM Content Manager), **CMOD** (IBM Content Manager OnDemand), **Box®** and **CMIS** (Content Management Interoperability Services) compliant repositories like **Alfresco®** and **Microsoft SharePoint®** On-Premises.

    3\. From the folder structure on the left side of the screen, traverse and click on the **Focus Corp Docs / Human Resources / Onboarded Employees** folder representing content for onboarded employees.  

    ![13](./images/110c-Navigator-OnboardedEmployees.png)

    As shown the diagram above, the center or content area of the screen shows the selected content which may also be used to traverse the folder structure. Additionally, the top of the content area displays the full folder structure of the selected content.

    4\. Click on the **Selena Swift** checkbox as shown in the diagram below.  

    Please note that the folder can be selected by either clicking on the checkbox -OR- by clicking on the folder row. If a checkbox is not visible, contact your administrator to enable **Content list checkboxes** at the desktop level. Clicking on the folder name text will select the folder and additionally traverse into the folder.

    ![13](./images/115-Navigator-SelenaSwift.png)

    For onboarded employee – **Selena Swift**, you can see custom folder properties such as the **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Employee ID**, **Onboarded** status and **Hire Date**.

    5\. Navigate to the **Focus Corp Docs / Human Resources / Onboarded Employees / Selena Swift / Employee Packet** folder and then click on the checkbox for the first document. Next, in the upper-right corner, select the different **Views** (**Details**, **Magazine**, **Filmstrip**). As shown in the diagram below, the **Details** view is shown as the default view.  

    ![13](./images/120c-Navigator-EmployeePacket.png)

    In our example, Focus Corp maintains an **Employee Packet** folder that contains new employee info documents such as the **Confidentiality Agreement** and **Employee Manual**. In the **Details** view, you are able to see the thumbnail and properties of the selected content.

    6\. Select the **Magazine** view  

    ![13](./images/121-Navigator-Magazine.png)

    In the **Magazine** view, you can now see the same content along with social features such as **Likes**, **Tags**, **Downloads** and **Comments**.

    7\. Select the **Filmstrip** view. The **Filmstrip** view is very useful for looking at media such pictures. Select the **Photos** folder below the **Employee Packet** folder and then select each picture document.

## 4. Create and Review Teamspace
<a name="lab-section-4"></a>
??? note SUMMARY "Expand to view"
    
    **Let’s now look at teamspaces. Teamspaces represent a focused view of the relevant folders, documents and searches that a team needs to complete their tasks.**

    Our use case revolves around Lucy reviewing an existing teamspace for employee applicant John Doe. Typicaly, the teamspace would already be created, processed and reviewed by a few HR processors before reaching Lucy to further review and approve the applicant for onboarding. In this section, you first create an employee onboarding teamspace for the employee applicant John Doe. Next, you will review how a teamspace is used once it is created. <br><br>

    <a name="lab-section-41"></a>
    ??? note SUMMARY "4.1 - Create Teamspace"
        
        An **Employee Onboarding** teamspace template should already be available. If not or if you want to learn more about creating teamspace templates, please proceed to the section below - [**4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder**](#lab-section-411). Otherwise, proceed to section [**4.1.2 - Teamspace Builder**](#lab-section-412). <br><br>

        <a name="lab-section-411"></a>
        ??? note SUMMARY "4.1.1 - Teamspace Template Builder"

            !!! info ""
                ℹ️  This section is recommended but optional. If you do not want to perform this section and use the existing teamspace template, please proceed to section [4.1.2 Teamspace Builder](#lab-section-412).
            
            This section covers the creation of a teamspace template using the teamspace template builder.

            The use of teamspace templates allows for the configuration of the folder hierarchy, documents, search templates, and security in a user-friendly wizard interface which can then be used to create teamspaces in a timely, secure and consistent manner.<br><br>

            1\. From the navigation menu, click on **Teamspaces**  

            ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/100-Teamspace-Feature.png)

            2\. Click on the **Templates** tab and then click on **New Template**  

            ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/110-New-Teamspace-Template.png)

            As shown in the diagram below, the **Teamspace Template Builder** is displayed.

            The teamspace template builder uses a wizard-driven user interface that guides you through the following steps:
            - Define Teamspace Template
            - Select Searches
            - Select Classes or Entry Templates
            - Folders and Documents Tree
            - Select Roles

             ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/120-Template-Builder.png)

            3\. Teamspace Template Builder - Define Teamspace Template  

            Enter a value for the **Template name** and **Template description**. If you are using a shared environment and plan to share the template, please select a value that distinguishes your template from others. In the diagram below, a generic template name and description is used for the employee onboarding use case and specified not to share the template.

            At this point, you can continue to the next step by clicking on the **Next** button for the remaining configuration items (searches, classes/entry templates, folders/documents and roles). At any point, you can complete the configuration of the template by clicking on the **Finish** button and optionally edit the configuration at a later time.

            When complete, click on the **Next** button to continue to the next step.

             ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/130-Define-Teamspace-Template.png)

            4\. Teamspace Template Builder - Select Searches  

            You will not specify any searches for the teamspace, click the **Next** button to continue to the next step

            ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/140b-Select-Searches.png)

            5\. Teamspace Template Builder - Select Classes or Entry Templates  

            This step specifies either document classes or entry templates that can be used to store documents into the teamspace. You will configure this step using classes. As shown in the diagram below, first click the option for **Use classes to add documents**. Select the **Employment Application** and the **Document** classes and click the **Add** button. Finally, click on the **Next** button to continue to the next step.

            ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/150-Template-Select-Classes.png)

            !!! note ""
                ℹ️ If the **Employment Application** class is not available, please contact your Administrator to make it available to you. Otherwise, selecting the default **Document** class is sufficient - you will just not see the custom properties (First Name, Last Name, Application Date) when adding the application document to the teamspace.

            6\. Teamspace Template Builder - Folders and Documents Tree

            This step configures the folder structure that will be used for the teamspace. Additionally, documents can be added to the folder(s). The use of a common folder structure and default documents provides a consistent process so that any teamspaces created with this template uses a consistent and standardized folder hierarchy and documents.

            Click **New Folder** and then build the folder structure shown below or create your own custom folder structure. To add a document to a folder, click on the **Add Document** button and add a document. When complete, click on the **Next** button to continue to the last step.

            ![13](./images/additional-assets/teamspace-template/160-Folders-Documents-Tree.png)

            7\. Teamspace Template Builder - Select Roles

            This steps allows you to either associate existing role templates or create custom roles for the teamspace template. Click **New Role**, enter a **Role Name** / **Role Description** and then set the desired permissions for the role.

            As shown in the diagram below, create one or more the following custom roles: HR - Human Resources, Payroll - Payroll, Manager - Department Manager, IT - Information Technology.

            Similar to the **Teamspace Template Builder**, the **Teamspace Builder** uses a wizard-driven user interface that guides you through the following steps:
            - Define Teamspace
            - Select Searches
            - Select Classes or Entry Templates
            - Folders and Documents Tree
            - Select Users

Using the template allows us to consistently build the teamspace ensuring the proper folder, documents, searches and roles are configured for every new project. At the same time, you are also able to slightly modify these settings as you create the teamspace for any additional configuration that may be needed for the specific teamspace.

            At this point, you can continue to the next step by clicking on the **Next** button for the remaining configuration items (searches, classes/entry templates, folders/documents and roles). At any point, you can complete the configuration of the template by clicking on the **Finish** button and optionally edit the configuration at a later time.

Annotations allow you to mark up a document with items such as lines, rectangles, redactions, text, highlights, sticky notes, pencil and stamps. Each annotation has security permissions and includes the user and timestamp the annotation was created/modified.

    !!! info ""
        ℹ️ The annotations displayed in the steps above/below may not be present if you did not create them when you added the document to the teamspace. If so, use the diagram to identify what would have displayed and optionally create the annotation identified in the step. Otherwise, simply ignore the step and continue to the next step.

Redaction Reasons use role-based security so that only users within a configured role can see behind the redaction and/or manage the redaction. Additionally, data capture/processing solutions can be configured to automatically redact values such as a Social Security Number and associate with the redaction reason.

    6\. Click **Cancel** to exit out of the **Select Redaction Reason** dialog window.  

    7\. From the annotation toolbar, click on the **Filled rectangle** annotation (also referred to as a redaction). Next, draw a rectangle around the Driver's License value (Y521793367692).

You will use the **Merge and Split** feature to first create a copy of our document and then remove the first five pages to create a separate I9 document. Next, you will remove the last four pages of our employment application document so that it only contains the correct pages.

    1\. From the upper-right corner of the viewer, select the **Open in New Window** icon to open the viewer in a separate window which allows us to select the **Merge and Split** option.

??? note SUMMARY "Expand to view"
    !!! info ""
        ℹ️ &nbsp; This section is optional, if you do not want to perform this section, please proceed to the next section. If you perform this section, please review section [4.3.2 Prepare Video Interview](#lab-section-432) to prepare the video with bookmarks.

    **Let's now take a look at the video viewer to view and stream videos and audio files.**

    1\. From your teamspace, click on the video name in the folder: **Employee Onboarding \ Application \ Video Interview**.  

     ![13](./images/380-Video-Launch.png)

    Note that selecting the video will also provide a short live preview of the video in the right pane along with the properties of the video.

    2\. Click on the **Open in New Window** icon in the upper right corner of the viewer to open the viewer in a new window so you can access the video bookmark feature.  

     ![13](./images/382-Video-OpenNewWindow.png)


    3\. Click on **Bookmarks** on the top left area of the viewer  

     ![13](./images/383-Video-Bookmarks.png)

    After selecting **Bookmarks**, the list of video bookmarks will be displayed. These were manually entered by an HR specialist during the initial application review process. Each bookmark identifies the name of the bookmark, bookmark description, the time of the bookmark and the user who created the bookmark. The use of video bookmarks is very valuable for Focus Corp to be able to quickly review key segments of the video without viewing the entire video. Additionally, the video viewer enables you to view, collaborate and easily stream large video files without requiring any browser plugins.

    Entering text in the **Filter** field also allows you to search on the name of the bookmark allowing for even faster location of a particular bookmark in the event there are numerous bookmarks. For example, enter **strengths** to quickly go to the bookmark named **What is your greatest strengths**

    4\. From the bookmark list, click on a bookmark and then cycle through the bookmarks by clicking on the **Previous** and/or **Next** buttons  

    ![13](./images/384-Video-PreviousNext.png)

    Notice that the video starts immediately as you click each bookmark with little or no lag. When the video is initially opened, the video can be played right away as the video is streamed in the background.

    5\. Let's now create a new bookmark. Locate a time in the video to create a bookmark. This can be done by playing the video and pausing at the desired location. Once you have a good idea where to place the bookmark, click on **New Bookmark** and then enter the **Name** and optionally the **Description**. If necessary, adjust the **Start Time** to the desired time in the video.
