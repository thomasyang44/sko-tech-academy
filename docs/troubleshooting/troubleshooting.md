## 71. Better logging : Using an external log service
<a name="faq-71"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"
    If you are using ROKS on IBM Cloud you can attach a log aggregation service running on IBM Cloud to your CP4BA
    cluster.

    Find the Log Analysis service in the IBM Cloud catalog and create an instance. The lite service doesn't have
    any log retention so choose the 7 Day search option.
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging1.png)
     
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging2.png)

    You'll be taken to the logging service page in IBM Cloud, refresh the page in a couple of minutes and your logging
    service will appear.
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging3.png)

    Find your cluster and click on its name to open the cluster details page.
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging4.png)
    
    Scroll down to the integrations area and connect to the logging service. Once connected the connect button will be
    replaced with a launch button.
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging5.png)
    
    In your apps your log output will now flow through to the log analysis service. In this example a BAW Toolkit
    is logging info messages, see "Darth Vader" below.
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging6.png)

    The log analysis service is now receiving all logs from the cluster. Y can now filter by source, here we are
    filtering for the **bastudio** pod but this isn't necessary, a global text search is still very effective.
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging7.png)

    At the bottom of the screen you can enter your search term to find the specific log output.
    ![oc console](./images/create-logging8.png)
    It is also useful to note the timestamp for the event then use "Jump To Timeframe" to find other events from
    other pods at the same timestamp for faultfinding. Log Analysis has many other features such as saved searches

## 80. Cases or a not starting up - ClassLoader issue
<a name="faq-80"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"
    
    When a user submits a client onboarding request (either from the end-to-end, or from the Workflow lab), the process to launch the Case is triggered and the case is triggered too but the case does not trigger any activities. This can be verified using Process Inspector and the Case Client. This is due to a ClassLoader known issue/bug. The way to resolve this is to re-create the cpe-deploy pod, load up ACCE and then re-create the bastudio pod.  
    
    Instructions to fix CPE Classloader problem (aka race condition)  
    1. Restart the CPE (cpe-deploy) Pod  
    2. Load the CPE Admin Console (ACCE), this will load the Java classes.  
    3. Restart the BA Studio (bastudio-deploy) Pod

## 82. I can't find BAWTOS, CLOS or cp4bausers
<a name="faq-82"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"
    Content including the labs are based on the IBM SWAT Client Onboarding[^1] materials which are configured for the **Production** pattern.  Our environment uses the **Starter** pattern and based on that, you may encounter some differences at certain steps.  
    <br>
    Below are some differences you should be aware of, please post to the slack channel if you encounter additional differences.  
    
    **General**  
    For the Starter pattern, use **cp4admin** instead of **cp4bausers** which is used in the Production pattern.   
        
    **Content**  
    Target object store: **TARGET** in Starter vs **BAWTOS** in Production  
    Anywhere you see **CLOS** object store, use the **CONTENT** object store.

    **Decisions**  
    Published automation service: The decisions project name contains the admin username which is different in Starter vs Production. The project name is included in the resource registry which would be different.

    **Navigator**  
    The desktop uses the target object store and because of the difference in target object store names, we have to create different desktops for Starter vs Production. This GitHub has been updated with the correct artifacts to use the correct object store for the Starter pattern.

    **App Designer**  
    The Client Onboarding app points to the target object store and this cannot be done with environment variables so we have to create different applications for Starter vs Production.  This GitHub has been updated with the correct artifacts to use the correct object store for the Starter pattern.
    Otherwise, you need to republish the Decisions automation service to match the correct resource registry name

    **Workflow**  
    Environment variable needs an update to point to the right target object store. This GitHub has been updated with the correct artifacts to use the correct object store for the Starter pattern.
    Otherwise, you need to republish the Decisions automation service to match the correct resource registry name

## 83. Rules changed in ADS but same result in Business App
<a name="faq-83"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"

    When rules are changed in a published ADS Automation Service you must publish a new version and update the app to 
    use the newly published automation service. (This is a bit odd after using ODM and not requiring apps to change
    as ODM and ADS both have the concept of `latest`, however this isn't supported in Automaiton Services until the
    next release).

    Updating the version of an Automation Service in a Business App requires us to add the new version of the 
    Automation Service. DO NOT try to edit the existing version of the Automation Service in App Designer.  In the 
    example below the app currently uses v4.0 of an Automation Service called `life_ds` published from ADS. 
    A new version of the business logic has been published as `life_ds` v4.1. To upgrade from v4.0 to v4.1 the 
    user would click on the Add buttnon.

    ![Update Automation Service](./images/83-1.png)
    
    Then select the new version of the Automation Service as shown, then click the Add button.
    ![Update Automation Service](./images/83-2.png)

    As there are no breaking changes (such as changes to the interface) the update will be integrated into the app
    automatically. When an automatic update isn't possible it is often easier to remove any previsouly generated code
    before adding the new version of the Automation Service.

## 84. Preparing BAI Data
<a name="faq-84"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"

    It is strongly recommended that you prepare the BAI data on a Mac as Windows can easily corrupt the JSON. The 
    instructions below assume you are using a Mac.

    Download or clone the github repository for the event to your Mac. Within this repo go to the location below: <br>
    `docs/client-onboarding/Solution Exports/Business Automation Insights`

    Within this directory you'll find the sample files : <br>

        Client Onboarding Completed.json
        ads-data.json
        case-data.json
        finalDashboardLayout.json
        process-data.json

    Two of these files have to be updated to reflect the index names in your CP4BA deployment.
    Using a text editor create a new file to called `commands.txt` , the name of the file doesn't matter, we'll
    just be using it to build and edit the commands. Copy the text below into your `commands.txt` file.

        ES_ADMIN=
        ES_PASSWORD=
        ES_HOST=
        curl -k -XGET -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_aliases

    Use the BAI values from the config map on your OpenShift cluster to update the `command.txt` file. Here is an 
    example with some of the password & URL obscured as an example:

        ES_ADMIN=icp4ba
        ES_PASSWORD=1Z*****Rj
        ES_HOST=https://iaf-system-es-cp4ba-starter.some-url.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud
        curl -k -XGET -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_aliases

    Copy the commands from your file and paste them into a terminal window on your Mac. This will set the user, password
    and URL and execute a curl command that will fetch the index names in your cluster. Take a note of the date used 
    within the index names, in the example below it is `2022.06.28` which is the date on which CP4BA was installed.

    ![bai index names](./images/bai-data-1.png){width="600"}

    To update `process-data.json` paste the following command into your `command.txt` file.
        
        sed -i.bak 's/2021.11.11/2022.06.28/g' process-data.json

    The sed command is a stream editor and in the example above it will perform a global find and replace, wherever
    it finds `2021.11.11` it will replace it with `2022.06.28`. Update this command to replace `2021.11.11` with the
    date from the curl command, (it won't be `2022.06.28` you must use the value for your system).

    When you execute the command the sample data in `process-data.json` should be updated, the command will also 
    create a backup file called `process-data.json.bak`

    To update `case-data.json` paste the following command into your `command.txt` file.
        
        sed -i.bak 's/2021.11.11/2022.06.28/g' case-data.json

    Again, make sure you update this command before you execute it. If you've made an error you can restore the original
    files from the backup.

    You can now upload the three sample data files (we only had to update two of them) by executing the following
    command in your terminal: 

        curl -k -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_bulk --data-binary @case-data.json
        curl -k -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_bulk --data-binary @process-data.json
        curl -k -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u ${ES_ADMIN}:${ES_PASSWORD} ${ES_HOST}/_bulk --data-binary @ads-data.json

    The BAI sample data has now been uploaded. You can now return to the deployment instructions and continue

## 91. Creating a git repo for ADS
<a name="faq-91"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"
    
    From your git home page click on the button to create a new repository and give it a meaningful name and click the
    green create button.
    ![git new repo](./images/git-0.png){width="300"}

    For ADS to connect to this repo you need to copy the URL which includes .git at the end.
    ![git url](./images/git-url.png)

    ADS also requires a personal access token that it uses for authenticating with git. To create this token go
    to settings. You get this by clicking on you icon in the top right corner.
    ![git settings](./images/git-1.png){width="300"}

    Within settings, now click on developer settings, this is in the left hand section at the bottom.

    In developer settings select personal access tokens, then click `Generate new token`
    ![git develoepr settings](./images/git-3.png)

    Give your token a name, this name isn't important it just so you can remember what the token is used for.
    ![token name](./images/git-4.png){width="500"}

    ADS requires repo priveledges, these are at the top. No other priveleges are needed by ADS.  
    ![rep settings](./images/git-5.png){width="500"}

    When the token is created copy it and paste it into the ADS github connection details along with the URL. You
    will not be able to retrieve this token again so make sure you copy it down now.

## 95. Adding Certificate for RPA Server (CP4BA Starter)
<a name="faq-95"></a>
??? note summary "Expand to view"

    These are the steps required to enable connectivity between BAW and a remote RPA node. The example below will
    connect BAW (in this case running within BA Studio as part of CP4BA Starter) to a TechZone VM running RPA
    studio using a simple synchronous Rest API call. You should be able to adapt these instructions to enable BAW to
    call other untrusted servers.  
    
    These steps should be performed after Daffy steps 1 & 2, and before step 3.  

    1. Obtain the pem file (certificate) for the remote server. Log into the RPA VM and open Firefox. Click on the
    bookmark for IBM RPA Server, click the icon next to the address then click the button labeled 'Connection not secure'  
    ![Certificate Info](./images/cert-1.png){width="500"}  
    On the next dialogue box click 'More information'.  
    ![More Info](./images/cert-2.png){width="500"}  
    When the information panel opens click on the view button.  
    ![Info Panel](./images/cert-3.png){width="500"}  
    Now scroll down until you find the link to download the PEM cert.  
    ![certificate download](./images/cert-4.png){width="500"}
    2. Create the pem file to your bastion. You can open the pem file in an editor and copy the contents of the file
    into a new file on your bastion.
    3. Log into your OpenShift cluster using the CLI (you may need a login token from the OpenShift Web Console)
    and create an OpenShift secret in the cp4ba-starter project using the command below. You may have to adapt the
    command if you created the pem file in a different location.  
    ```
    oc create secret generic rpa-secret --from-file=tls.crt=/data/daffy/env/rpa.pem -n cp4ba-starter
    ```
    4. Update the CR to add the secret containing the pem file. As the formatting in YAML is critical it is not
    safe to provide the code here. Use the image below to help you find the updated code in this [sample YAML](rpa-updated.yaml), update
    your YAML file accordingly:  
    ![RPA Secret](./images/rpa-secret.png){width="600"}
    Pay extra attention to indentation using spaces. It is recommended that you use an editor that understands the
    syntax of yaml.

    5. The final change is to deactivate the SSL validation in the Liberty server used to host BAW. Again this change
    is present in the [sample YAML](rpa-updated.yaml). Use the image below to help you find the changes in the sample yaml
    file and apply this to your CR.  
    ![Custome XML](./images/custom-xml.png){width="600"}

    6. You can now proceed with step 3 of the Daffy build and create the CP4BA services. It is possible to modify the CR and reapply it to a running
    CP4BA cluster but this is beyond the scope of this guide.
