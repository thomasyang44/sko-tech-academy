**Steps to Cloud Pak Deployment**  
All roads lead to Cloud Pak. The Daffy automation process is a three step process. You can start at step 1 or step 2 or even step 3. For example, if you do not have a cluster, start at step 1.  If you have OpenShift Cluster already, start at step 2. If you have a OpenShift cluster and already have base cloud pak installed, but just need to deploy a cloud pak service, start at step 3.
