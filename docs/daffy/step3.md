This file is where you store values that will define your environment and that Daffy will use to build your environment.

Go to the samples directory:
```    
cd /data/daffy/env/samples
```

As a starting point, copy a sample environment file from the samples folder located here:  
```
/data/daffy/env/samples/<platform>-env.sh
```

For SKO Tech Academy, we will use CP4BA on the ROKS platform:
```
/data/daffy/env/samples/cp4ba-env.sh
```

You will copy the environment file and rename it using this format:
```
/data/daffy/env/<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>-env.sh
```

** Best practice is <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> is your cluster name but not required.

<br>
This command will copy the the sample file and place it in the /data/daffy/env directory (back one folder)
```
cp cp4ba-env.sh ../data/daffy/env/<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>-env.sh
```

Here are the values of the file:
```
DAFFY_UNIQUE_ID="<YourID@ibm.com>"
#This is required - Values POC/Demo/Enablement/HCCX/TechZone
DAFFY_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=""
#If POC/Demo, these are required.
#ISC number must be 18 characters
#DAFFY_ISC_NUMBER="0045h00000w1nvKAAG"
#DAFFY_CUSTOMER_NAME="Acme Customer"

BASE_DOMAIN="<YOUR.BASEDOMAIN.COM>"
CLUSTER_NAME="<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>"
OCP_RELEASE="4.8.36"
VM_TSHIRT_SIZE="Large"
```
