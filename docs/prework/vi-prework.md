# Vi Pre-Work

Before Tech Academy there was optional pre-work to learn the vi editor.

For these instructions visit  [Tech Academy Pre-work on YL](https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/EL01-00000147?planId=PLAN-B3814805BBB4&sectionId=SECTION-B).

If you can open a file with vi, make changes and save it, then you're probably ok.
