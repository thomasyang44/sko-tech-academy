## 1. Goal
The general aim of this advanced training is to make the technical sellers PoT/PoC ready for the portfolio. At the end of this training, the technical sellers should be able to take a customer problem, use their knowledge of the portfolio, then plan, define and execute the PoC/PoT using the components in the portfolio.

## 2. Statement of Approach
Attendees are expected to grow deep skills across the CP4BA portfolio including RPA and Process Mining.Â  Each attendee will be placed in teams with a mix of capability specific skills and are expected to select labs that will build their capability skills where they need the most depth.

## 3. Learning Objectives
After this event, tech sellers should be able to do a PoC targeting a customer use case.   

* Individually, install CP4BA starter pattern (advanced attendees to use production pattern)
* As a team:
    * Deploy seven prebuilt artifacts (ADS, Workflow, etc...) on a cluster
    * Integrate and test deployed artifacts
    * Rebuild selected artifacts (ADS, Workflow, etc...), likely one capability per team member
    * Learn how to effectively demonstrate the client onboarding demo that spans across the Cloud Pak for Business Automation (CP4BA)
 
Active participation will be critical to the success of this course. Specifically, there will be tremendous value learning from your peers not only on the capabilities but by discussing experiences executing a client PoC.
