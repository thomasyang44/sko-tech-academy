## 1. Goal
The general aim of this advanced training is to make the technical sellers PoT/PoC ready for the portfolio. At the end of this training, the technical sellers should be able to take a customer problem, use their knowledge of the portfolio, then plan, define and execute the PoC/PoT using the components in the portfolio.

## 2. Statement of Approach
Attendees are expected to grow deep skills across the CP4BA portfolio including RPA and Process Mining.  Each attendee will be placed in teams with a mix of capability specific skills and are expected to select labs that will build their capability skills where they need the most depth. 

## 3. Learning Objectives
After this event, tech sellers should be able to do a POC targeting a customer use case.   

* Individually, install CP4BA starter pattern (advanced attendees to use production pattern)
* As a team:
    * Deploy seven prebuilt artifacts (ADS, Workflow, etc...) on a cluster
    * Integrate and test deployed artifacts
    * Rebuild selected artifacts (ADS, Workflow, etc...), likely one capability per team member
    * Learn how to effectively demonstrate the client onboarding demo that spans across the Cloud Pak for Business Automation (CP4BA)
