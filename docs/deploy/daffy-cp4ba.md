# Daffy - CP4BA Deployment

As part of the pre-work you created a bastion server, installed Daffy and created a daffy environment file. Before
we create the cluster please update your daffy environment by running the install command again :
```commandline
wget http://get.daffy-installer.com/download-scripts/daffy-init.sh; chmod 777 daffy-init.sh;./daffy-init.sh
```
This environment file needs to be updated before Daffy can deploy the CP4BA cluster. Login to your bastion server and update the environment file you created using the sample below as a template.

The values that you will update are:  
    - **DAFFY_UNIQUE_ID**  
    - **CLUSTER_NAME**  
    - **ROKS_ZONE**  

Here is a sample environment file:
```
#No spaces and only AlphaNumeric and  @ or . or -
DAFFY_UNIQUE_ID="PLEASE-SET-TO-EMAIL-ADDRESS"

#OpenShift Cluster info

CLUSTER_NAME="PLEASE-SET-CLUSTER-NAME"

Copy the contents of this file into the Daffy environment file on your bastion server and update the three
placeholders for **DAFFY_UNIQUE_ID**, **CLUSTER_NAME**, **ROKS_ZONE**.  

!!! warning
    Please select a data center (DC) from either the **Americas** or **EMEA** column.  
    There is an upper limit for the number of storage volumes we can create in each DC so we must try to distribute 
    cluster creation across several DC's. You won't be using these clusters for the labs so their location isn't 
    important.

!!! note
    If you have your own **IBM Cloud** account with infrastructure please use this account when Daffy asks you to log in.  
    <br>
    Please note that if you use your own account, you may see a **FAIL** message regarding resource group (ie. Default or TechAcademyBA), you can ignore this message.  


Please name your clusters `daffy-yourfirstname-yourlastname` eg. `daffy-tom-cruise`. This is so we can find them easily.

Daffy will deploy CP4BA and other CloudPaks using a CR yaml file (also known as a Custom Resource file) that
specifies exactly what to install. These yaml CR are not part of Daffy itself, they can be customized and will evolve.
The CR that installs the CP4BA in this exercise is located here :

```commandline
/data/daffy/cp4ba/templates/services/samples/roks-starter-all-IF008.yaml
```

The CP4BA environment created from this CR will contain the major components of CP4BA, look in the yaml file to see
exactly what is installed. The CR we'll be using later in the Tech Academy is very similar to this sample, the only
difference is made to enable communication to the Tech Zone RPA environment (these changes will be described in the FAQ for
those interested).

!!! note
    If you have previously run a Daffy deployment from your bastion, please run the cleanup script `/data/daffy/cleanup.sh` before proceeding.


Once you have updated your environment file, save it and exit the editor. Proceed to the next step [Cluster Build](cluster.md)
